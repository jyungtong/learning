Introduction to Climate Risk Financing

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Rowan Douglas discussed the fundamentals of climate risk financing, emphasising its crucial role in mitigating future risks through strategic investments.Climate risk finance is crucial for providing at-risk communities with the resources they need to recover and rebuild after climate-related disasters, protecting their assets, income, and livelihoods from increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters.Governments play a key role in keeping climate risk financing available and affordable. By creating supportive policies, they help manage the financial impacts of climate hazards and ensure communities are resilient.For organisations, it's vital to include climate risk in their financial planning and investments. This not only ensures long-term sustainability but also helps organisations stay resilient and secure necessary investments.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Introduction to Climate Risk Financing  Host:  The increasing frequency of natural disasters and climate related challenges has birthed a new field at the nexus of finance, climate science and risk management.  This new area is called Climate Risk Finance.  With the global race to address climate change, it's becoming an extremely important sector. After all, in 2023 alone, natural catastrophe losses globally amounted to US$250 billion and more than 74,000 deaths. Climate risk finance is needed to help the people and places affected already and those who will be affected in the future.  So what exactly is climate risk finance?  To answer this, we're joined by Rowan Douglas, CEO of Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden Group, an independent insurer with a presence in over 50 countries. Rowan will explain what climate risk finance is, the drivers behind it and why it matters for you and your organisation.  Rowan Douglas:  Ultimately, it's all about trying to retrain Adam Smith's 'Invisible Hand' to take account of climate risks in a, in a coherent way. And if we don't take account of risks properly when we're making decisions about investment or operations, when we're not taking account of the full picture, and ultimately it can lead to lost assets and lost income, but actually it can lead to lost lives and lost livelihoods.  Climate risk finance for me has sort of two halves. So the first sort of bucket of climate risk finance is trying to make sure that we know the risks that our operations or our assets face from climate and natural hazards, knowing that while we might seek to make them as resilient as possible and adapt as best we can to current and future conditions, when the most extreme  
events occur, floods, windstorms, droughts, we are going to suffer losses and damages, whether we're governments or whether we're individuals.  And one of the most important things we need to sort of bear in mind when these foreseeable but unpredictable events happen, is to make sure that when that happens, we're going to have some access to resources to recover, to rebuild to and get back on our feet. So it's about having a contingent asset to have a contingent pool of resources available for when these contingent risks occur. And contingent risks mean that risks you know are out there, but you don't quite know when they're going to manifest themselves.  The other bucket, climate risk being embedded in the decision making that investors and others make when they're actually embarking on building facilities or upgrading facilities. And it's making sure that sort of climate risk is incorporated into those decisions so that assets and income is as reliable as possible. That basically means that facilities, including homes and hospitals and schools are as sort of climate resilient as possible and that's built into the, to the design because actually it's the economically right thing to do.  Insurance   and   insurability is about to become an increasing public policy issue because ultimately if, if things aren't insurable, not only are people exposed and precarious and vulnerable, but often it means that then certain things begin to get difficult to obtain, particularly credit and investment, and then that becomes sort of this cycle of, of financial exclusion which then has all sorts of, you know, significant challenges. So the governments are important in creating the rules of the game for insurance, but also they're going to be important to other things too.  One is to help create the conditions where things maintain insurability. Now, 150 years ago, the climate change issue at the time was urban fire. We were busy industrialising massive cities. Massive   fires   led   to,   you   know,   terrible   losses   of   life,   but   also   assets.   Things became uninsurable, effectively, and insurers and governments got together and between them, with the help of engineers, created zoning laws and building codes and fire departments every couple of miles, such that urban morphology was changed to structurally reduce fire risk, as well as requiring people to have insurance to get loans. And those insurance policies had requirements on the individuals to manage their properties and do things properly.  It's going to be the same in climate risk. There's going to be things we have to do strategically and structurally make sure that we reduce risk. There's going to be the requirement in certain instances for a level of subsidisation of insurance and mutualization.  
About half of the premiums in the U.S. agricultural insurance sector are subsidised by the government   because   the   government   sees   food   security   and   the   maintenance   of   rural communities economically as, you know, strategic national priority, which the country as a whole should have a role in supporting. In many jurisdictions there's a growing requirement for companies   to   understand   and   ultimately   disclose   their   exposure   to   climate   risks.   The requirements of economies to decarbonize over the next two or three decades. You may not be a significant emitter, but maybe some of the industries you serve are carbon intensive and those are going to go through massive changes.  So that means your client base is going to change a lot. There's massive insurance requirements to support the low carbon transition. We just did some research with BCG, there's going to be US$10 trillion worth more insurance required by 2030 than today, simply to fund the US$20 trillion of committed investment in renewables and other areas. There's also going to be a 50% rise we expect in natural disaster and sort of related property insurance requirements in the next five or six years. It's not clear that the market can organically respond to that. So insurance will become essential to access credit.  So companies should be thinking about, you know, insurance as the platform of their capital stack. But on a more positive note, climate is going to become an area of competition and I think those companies that see the angle for them in the economic transformation we're having in a low carbon economy that could really offer, you know, exciting opportunities as well.  Being in climate 10 years ago was seen as a career turbocharger. I would say that now to have a climate and expertise in one's personal armoury a good thing to have in terms of future proofing one's role in the business. And it can be right across the business from HR through to finance through to obviously sales and operations.  Host:  Embedding climate risk considerations into financial planning is increasingly being recognised as essential   for   long-term   sustainability   and   economic   stability.   Climate   risk   finance   gives companies, communities, and governments a contingent pool of resources to recover and rebuild after unforeseen events.  This ensures that assets, income, and livelihoods are protected from the brunt of increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters.  
For instance, from 1980 to 2023, the U.S. has experienced 376 weather and climate disasters, with cumulative costs exceeding 2.6 trillion dollars.  Protecting against such impacts will require the development of policies that regulate and foster an environment of insurability, as Rowan shared. The government will therefore play a vital role in keeping climate risk insurance available and affordable through measures like subsidisation.  At the same time, climate risk financing is becoming a requirement for the private sector because all companies face financial risks posed by climate change, even if they don't directly contribute to it themselves.  Integrating climate risk finance enables a competitive and resilient private sector, which not only mitigates potential losses but also positions companies to capitalise on emerging opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Change in the Chinese Context

### keyTakeaway
Over the past 45 years, China has undergone profound socioeconomic changes, transitioning from rapid economic growth to a focus on sustainable, high-quality development. Pascal Coppens highlighted how Chinese companies have navigated these transformations by leveraging their cultural adaptability, market demands, and global pressures.Cultural Adaptability: Rooted in its dynamic history, China's cultural focus on adaptability has enabled it to thrive amidst constant change, viewing transformation as progress rather than disruption.Market-Driven Innovation: Initiatives like "Made in China 2025," paired with rising consumer demand for quality, have driven companies to improve products and compete globally.Geopolitical Catalysts: External pressures, particularly from U.S. competition, have spurred Chinese businesses to innovate and demonstrate their capability on the global stage, fuelling a high-stakes innovation race.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Change in the Chinese Context  Host:  In the last 45 years, China has faced some of the most rapid and significant socioeconomic changes the world has seen. And in recent years we've seen China's development strategy shift from rapid growth to sustainable high quality development. In this sense, innovation has needed to be embedded at multiple levels of society.  So how have Chinese companies navigated this change?  To answer this question, we have Pascal Coppens, a prominent expert on China's innovation and business landscape with over 20 years of experience in the country. Pascal is the author of two books on China and is a practitioner and advisor to startups, multinationals and governments in the fields of artificial intelligence, e-commerce and digital transformation.  Pascal draws on his first hand experience to make connections between China's innovation potential, its culture and its adaptive business environment.  Pascal Coppens:  So I believe when we look at China, the one thing that most people say about China is the only constant is change. And I think that's a mindset that they've had for at least 45 years since the opening up of China in 1979.  What you could see is that every decade almost there was a new industrial revolution coming to China. So they had to adapt instantly. I mean the urbanisation, I mean everything changed in China, the way of digitalisation and so on, but it happened so fast and so disruptive that people got used to every 10 years having a complete new environment. And what we forget is that it's not just about the past 45 years, it's actually about the past 3,000 years or 2,500 years, because the oldest book in the world is called the Book of Change and that's the I-Ching.  
And so it's really about adapting to that new environment is something culturally very strong in China while we outside China, specifically in Europe, where I'm based, I mean, we're looking for more stability and don't like change because we feel comfortable in a way how we are. But in China, change is often about progress and about improvement and that is the mindset they've had.  The biggest change was in 1979 when they had to change to sudden open market. And that is something that we feel it's normal because that's what we had in the world. But for Chinese it was very new. And how do you compete in a new market that's completely open? And I think that's something that China and India, by the way also has, is that they see this market growing every year and it grew at an enormous pace, which means that the pie is growing. And so it doesn't mean that you want to compete just to take market share from somebody else. You want to compete to be the first one into that new market. And so the competition is much more fierce.  Now, take that 10 years ago, around 2013, where it was really more about quality. In 2015, we had the Made in China 2025 plan. And so that was where suddenly quality was on the high agenda of the government. I think another mistake that we're often making outside China is assuming that Beijing has set the stage and everybody adapted to that new reality. That is part of the truth, the real truth and the extensive truth is really the fact that the consumers in 2015 wanted better quality products in China and of course, globally.  And the local competitors or local Chinese companies had to compete with high quality coming out of Europe, coming out of America. And so they had to raise their bar and get more quality to compete with international companies, because the local consumers and the local buyers wanted higher quality. And so it's driven by the market. It's not so much driven only by Beijing, but the combination of those two is quite lethal, because suddenly you have the budgets available that Beijing offers and the subsidies.  Combine that with the DNA of agility that the Chinese have and adaptability of change. I think the challenge outside China, specifically in Western countries, is to learn that the future will not always be like the past has been. And I think the last years we've come to realise that, but for the Chinese has been very normal. So learning from China, how they had to live with and always changing, I think is a good way to adapt ourselves to that new reality.  So one of the reasons that the Chinese were changing as well in the past seven, eight years, since 2017 about, is really because of geopolitical change. I mean, it was very clear when Trump  
took office and later on Biden, that it was a lot about we have to be careful that the Chinese will not surpass us in terms of innovation, in terms of quality, in terms of product. And so the Chinese felt this as a containment somehow, and that forced them, or at least it got them to more and more want to focus on this quality, to prove to the world that we can do this ourselves. The industry and the companies felt very proud to show we are Chinese and we can do as well as anybody else can.  And so, in a way, this geopolitical tensions that we had from the US has driven a lot of Chinese companies to want to innovate more, to hire more engineers, to get more IP out of the door. And so I think this tension is helping China now it has become a race.  So now the question is, can they catch up? Well, in some stages they're already ahead, and others they're still behind. That's a trillion dollar question. But ultimately the fact that they're doing it is something to watch.  Host:  China has faced constant change since its economic opening in 1979. Every decade has brought new industrial revolutions, requiring rapid adaptation that has been rooted in China's cultural emphasis on change. Unlike Europe's preference for stability, change in China is seen as progress.  As Pascal has pointed to, China focused on improving the quality of its products through the Made in China 2025 plan, driven both by government initiatives and rising consumer demand for better products. Geopolitical tensions, especially with the US further pushed Chinese companies to innovate, aiming to match or surpass global competitors.  This has positioned China as a major player in the global innovation race, with new developments emerging daily.

Innovation Ecosystems in China

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Pascal Coppens explained how China has transitioned from replicating Western innovations to developing complex and self-sustaining innovation ecosystems in recent decades. Here are his main observations:Modular Ecosystems: Chinese companies adopt modular structures with micro-enterprises, empowering employees as entrepreneurs and using digital platforms to share resources and data efficiently.Collaborative and Competitive Partnerships: Partnerships span companies, governments, and industries, balancing competition and collaboration to drive innovation aligned with local and national goals.Six S’s of Ecosystems: Speed, scale, skills, savings, sustainability, and security - these enable resilience, adaptability, and rapid growth across industries.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Innovation Ecosystems in China  Host:  Innovation in China has gone through rapid transformations in the last two decades, initially replicating Western innovations to now producing complex innovation ecosystems of its own. To explore the main characteristics of China's modern innovation ecosystems, you'll hear from Pascal Coppens, a prominent expert on China's innovation and business landscape with over 20 years of experience in the country.  Pascal is the author of two books on China and is a practitioner and advisor to startups, multinationals and governments in the fields of artificial intelligence, e-commerce and digital transformation.  Pascal Coppens:  Ecosystems in China is both internal and external, and I think that's a real big difference between how many people in the West or outside China look at ecosystems. So when you look at it internally, it's quite fascinating to see how these Chinese companies have been able to break down their company in many microenterprises and making almost entrepreneurs from their employees. It's a holistic system. It's not something you want to control, it's something that kind of lives on itself. And letting go of that control is one of the most difficult things in ecosystems.  But once you have this modular environment, you need digital platforms. And that's where the Chinese have been very good at, both to monitor, to share data, to get access to resources, and all that helps the employee to become an entrepreneur and do something with it itself. So that's something we can definitely learn is from the internal ecosystems.  And most Chinese companies, they try to grow the ecosystem rather than grow the business. And I think that's a huge difference, because if you want to grow the ecosystem, that means  
that you go into different industries, you follow the user, you try to figure out where the next opportunity is, and by doing that, you grow your business by default.  When we think about ecosystems, we often think about partnerships and alliances. And lots of companies you work with, and Chinese have that too. But that's the next level, and that's the level where they actually work a lot with partners, not so much as complementary, but even sometimes competitive. It's like a race to making sure that the one that gets there first is the one that you want to continue working with, and the other one might have to next time have a better chance or a better product to keep on in that race. And so it's a different way of looking at it.  But what I truly like about these external ecosystems is how the Chinese are putting KPIs and partnerships, not just with companies, but also with the government. And I'm not just talking about the central government because they put the guidelines out, but also the local governments in China very often are listening to what's happening on the ground, because they have these companies that want to build these ecosystems together with them.  And so I think that's kind of some of the points I would break it down. But most important is that an ecosystem is kind of open, so you invite other people to join. And that's why you needed to have these digital platforms to allow it.  So in the Chinese context, when you look at these ecosystems, they create many different things. I call that actually the six S's, speed, scale, skills, savings, as well as sustainability and security. So that's lot of S's, but when you look purely at speed, it's very much that.  When you have a lot of partners that all try to do things themselves and they all are kind of competing in that same ecosystem, and that allows you to really monitor who's the fastest within that ecosystem. It's to not try to do everything yourself, but to try to do it all together.  And that, of course, creates also scale, because if you scale in terms of modular environments, you can very quickly have a small department becoming a big company on itself, and maybe another company can split into two and then scale again. And so there's a lot of modularity in there, and that creates the scale.  If you look at a company like Haier, which is one of the biggest white good companies in the world, I mean, the way that they have like 8,000 departments, I mean that scales globally at a very, very fast pace. And if you have a lot of modular global departments working together,  
that's where you get a lot of skills as well. I mean, you can save a lot of money with these ecosystems.  Talking about sustainability, I think there, it's really about being ready for any attack or any problem or any change that the company experiences. I mean, the best example is COVID-19, a company like Haier, they were the first company that was back on their feet because the company was completely in lockdown in China. But then a month later, or two months later, they were in lockdown in other countries. And so they could shift production, shift design, shift innovation very, very quickly. And by doing that, they become a very sustainable organism in itself.  But it's also about security and making sure when something goes wrong that you can actually get back on track.  Host:  China is developing modern approaches to innovation ecosystems, where companies break into micro enterprises, enabling employees to act as entrepreneurs, supported by digital platforms for data and resource sharing. This modular structure allows companies to grow ecosystems by expanding into various industries.  At the same time, many Chinese companies have found success by forming competitive partnerships often working closely with local governments to align with national policies and customer needs.  As Pascal described, the six benefits of these ecosystems are speed, scale, skills, savings, sustainability, and security.

Purpose: Creating Scale through Collective Action

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Bercasio emphasised the importance of personal engagement, community involvement, and sustained efforts in fostering a movement towards social change,Achieving scale of impact is a result of fostering a grassroots movement amongst individuals across communities, each guided by a strong sense of purpose.Scale is difficult enough to achieve; sustaining it necessitates CSOs leveraging robust community engagement strategies, effective digital platforms, and consistent support for volunteer networks.Addressing societal shortfalls demands that the more privileged segments of society acknowledge their role in systemic change, actively participating in community initiatives.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Purpose: Creating Scale Through Collective Action  Host:  How do we achieve scale? It's a question that occupies organisations of all kinds. There's no one size fits all answer. But there are successful examples we can learn from and emulate. And these examples aren't always from businesses.  We can also learn from civil society organisations too.  In the case of the Gawad Kalinga Community Development Foundation, which to date has provided land and shelter to more than 100,000 families in 3,000 communities throughout the Philippines, scale is not merely a target, but an outcome of cultivating a shared movement. When a person's personal motivations align with a greater cause they identify with, their commitment and impact extends beyond the individual to their families, colleagues and eventually their communities.  To explore this concept further, Gawad Kalinga's Executive Director, Dan Bercasio will now share how creating a purpose-driven movement allowed for their initiatives to scale organically.  Dan Bercasio:  When we talk of scale in our experience, it is also a consequence of our push to create a movement not just nationwide, but around this small community.  So scale is not just a target. Hey, we want to reach 10,000 communities this year. But actually scale is a consequence of building that movement of Filipinos and friends of Filipinos who want also to have their own personal transformation story. And going back to the point of how can we make it personal, it goes beyond me as Dan Bercasio. It is also important and actually more challenging how to engage your family. For many of us, we start as individuals but eventually it now becomes a story of a family, our own family, helping create a different history for our country.  
So that's why we are also making sure that as we scale, we are not only be able to count or to check, or to measure the impact, but also more importantly, how can we sustain and support this backbone, this volunteer-based backbone across the Philippines, where we are composed of 7,421 islands, it's really so difficult to connect people.  So we are taking advantage of digital platforms. But at the same time we make sure that we visit especially the provincial leaders regularly. Because since they are volunteers, they are not paid. We also need to sustain that conversation on how are they anchoring their personal mission in their locality. That's why it is important to have an anchor. For me personally, I truly believe that we as a people should not stop hoping for our country. We should not lose that capacity to hope.  Because the opposite of hope is discouragement. Discouragement, meaning from the root word courage. Losing that ingredient which is courage. So how can we sustain courage? I personally sustain courage by making it very personal. Because at the end of the day, this is my story. At the end of the day, it is when my life ends here on earth. The question is, how do I want my story to become?  Also at the same time, having an anchor should be very specific, down to the particular family or community. While poverty so massive, it is important for me personally to connect to at least one family or at least one community regularly, because that's where hope lives. That's where hope thrives. When we talk of poverty in the Philippines, it's not just the poor who needs to change. We, the not so poor Filipinos, also need to change.  That's why to sustain this kind of work, it's also important that we recognise how we are being transformed by this work. Not just looking at the poor who needs to change, but also as how are we being transformed as individuals, as Filipinos, as citizens, as global citizens?  Host:  When people are equipped with the knowledge, understanding, practical tools and frameworks, it is possible to create scale organically.  According to Mr. Bercasio, getting an initiative or venture to reach the point of a chain reaction first requires individuals to have a strong sense of purpose, or what he aptly describes as an anchor. This is the ‘why’ behind your actions. When these anchors unite within the broader  
framework of an initiative, the resulting collective action naturally becomes a driving catalyst for scale.  However, as Mr. Bercasio says, it's also important to recognise that change should be a two way street, impacting not only those we seek to help, but also those endeavouring to create a difference.

To Profit or Not to Profit? An Innovative Dual-system Approach

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Bercasio shared how Gawad Kalinga navigates its dual role as both a non-profit organisation focused on community engagement and a for-profit entity.Collaboration with the government is a necessity when addressing complex social issues that require systemic solutions and a large amount of resources. By working with CSOs, governments can tap into grassroots networks, local knowledge, and community trust to implement effective and sustainable initiatives.By maintaining a nonpartisan stance, CSOs can collaborate across political affiliations, ensuring that initiatives prioritise the needs of the communities they serve rather than advancing any particular political agenda.GK operates both nonprofit and for-profit entities, recognising the need for different operational frameworks. While nonprofit endeavours prioritise community engagement and collaboration, for-profit initiatives focus on efficiency and risk absorption.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  To Profit or Not to Profit?  An Innovative Dual-System Approach  Host:  When most people think of a civil society organisation or CSO, they think of a non-profit group.  But what happens when CSOs pursue a for-profit model?  This might sound counterintuitive, but there can be major upsides to this approach when  executed   correctly,   including   sustained   financial   independence,   attracting   a   more   skilled  workforce or more reinvestment into the organisation's mission. However, given that both  non-profit and for-profit CSOs have different models and objectives, how they interface with  stakeholders and how they function will also vary. One example of this is the Gawad Kalinga  Community Development Foundation, a Philippine-based CSO dedicated to eradicating poverty  and restoring human dignity since its formation in 2003.  Let's hear from Dan Bercasio, Gawad Kalinga's Executive Director about the intricacies of  navigating engagements with stakeholders while serving as both a non-profit and for-profit CSO.  Dan Bercasio:  There are two aspects of GK; GK that is more known to people, especially in the Philippines, is  the non-profit GK. Wherein the default for us is to engage the government. While some NGOs  stay away from engaging the government for us, because we are looking at the 5 million poorest  families in the country, we know that we cannot do it alone.  It is only if we, if the government is into it, that we can solve that problem. So they have a very  important role in all of these things. Engaging the government is very challenging, but for us it is  a must because the role of GK is just to bridge the gap between the civil society and the  government. And we are glad if there are towns wherein we are not needed anymore, wherein  the government's doing well. It's whenever we engage government, especially on the local level,  we make sure that we enter on a more supportive role. Not just connecting relationships or  
healing mistrusts from the private sector, but also make sure that we build up a culture of  collaboration, especially among the private sectors in the local area.  And at the same time, having GK in the equation also depoliticises everything. It also makes it  easy for, let's say, government officials to raise funds because they can say, hey don't worry, the  funds will go through NGOs like GK. It will not go through our pockets. And since the work is  almost always as a collaboration with even the beneficiaries, no single organisation now owns  the single project. It's owned by everyone, so it depoliticises things.  But the challenge in engaging government is aside from the mayors, we have local elections  after three years, so the continuity is difficult. As a non-profit we are consistent with our policy  that we are non-partisan. Yes, we are very political in such a way we help address political issues  or social issues.  But we are non-partisan. During elections, we don't support a particular candidate in all levels  from the local to the national. What we build upon is the culture of building local leaders  regardless of their political affiliation. GK is a volunteer-based organisation, meaning more than  5,000 people that are running GK on a regular basis. Only 150 are employees. The rest are  volunteers.  So these local leaders, if they so decide to run for office, they need to give up their leadership  position in GK so that GK will remain to be non-partisan. And at the same time on the continuity  we engage the incumbent and we sustain our relationship with the government employees  does not change. And we also make sure that we sustain our presence in the communities  through these volunteers. So government is key.  But they are not just the only ingredient in building up a community in a particular, let's say  locality. For the non-profit, we have partnered with corporations wherein they engage GK so  that they could where they, for example, there's a company who produces ice cream and they  need ube. It's a root crop. Ube in the Philippines is mostly imported. Why cannot we produce  our own ube?  So they engage us to organise communities who has the potential of producing that particular  root crop. So that's one way of engaging or taking advantage the trends of NGOs like us making  a contribution in their supply chain by engaging communities.  
Another one is we have a partner wherein they help us set up production hubs or processing  hubs which goes both ways. Meaning it transfers the efficiencies or the scale to GK. It gives us  the capacity to not just buy raw and then sell raw, but also to produce and to process  agriculture products and connect them to market a higher value. That way we will be able to  transfer much of the profit to the farmers. Now these corporations can also also either be they  help us set up the processing facilities, but because they will also buy from us.  So it helps them because instead of just engaging random traders or random communities  which they are not quite sure if some of the farmers will pole vault or sell to others. At least  engaging with entities like GK that has relationships with the farmers and fisher folk so they're  more secured of that supply chain. The non-profit side of GK, while we heavily engage the  government and business sector and even volunteers, we do that so that we are able to bring  people together.  In many times it puts us in a difficult position because we are adding sources of variables. What  if the mayor does this? What if the volunteer doesn't show up? What if the corporation  suddenly said we have changed strategies. So there are sources of variables. But for us it's a  given because our objective is not just to implement the project, but bring people together.  Now that is the non-profit side of GK.  But on the other side, in helping farmers and fisher folk, we have established a for-profit entity  wherein it helps to build an ecosystem so that farmers and fisher folks could not just take  advantage of an ecosystem that is more friendly, but also get access to capital, get access to  production facilities and perhaps get connected to market.  The for-profit side of GK is really operating as a business wherein it also assumes most of the  risks that the farmers or fisher folk are currently bearing. So it shifts its risks by absorbing the  risk of the farmers and fisher folk. And at the same time, we hope that the business sector  would start also transforming the middle. Especially for the farmers and fisher folk.  Transforming the middle means hopefully they could also not just shorten the supply chain and  remove unnecessary just pass by players, but also hopefully they could also absorb some of the  risks that the poor are carrying. For us, as a non-profit, we are actually forced to set up a  for-profit which should be, which should be being done by businesses who have been there for  generations. They are the best, they're experts on business. But we are now forced to set up  for-profit because we believe we need to also start showing how can we transform the middle.  
Host:  As a CSO or any other organisation for that matter, adapting operational frameworks to match  specific goals is crucial to success. As Mr. Bercasio has shared, you can't achieve every goal with  the same approach.  In the non-profit realm, it is imperative to allocate adequate time and resources to directly  engage with both the communities you aim to assist and the other stakeholders who can help  facilitate that change.  Conversely, as a for-profit, it's about prioritising efficiency. Here the goal is to streamline  operations and reduce overheads, which often means spending less time on direct stakeholder  engagement, while still prioritising stakeholders who can sustain and support the organisation's  mission.  In Gawad Kalinga's case, this is the government. Both approaches have their merits and as  Gawad Kalinga's case teaches us, they need not be mutually exclusive, as combining both as  part of a well-balanced strategy makes it possible to achieve the best of both worlds.

Unleashing the Potential of Communities Through Convergence

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Bercasio broke down the potential of community engagement, emphasising the pivotal role of human capital and community spirit in fostering sustainable solutions to societal challenges.Sustainable solutions to complex issues like hunger require active participation and contribution from within the affected communities themselves, rather than solely relying on external interventions.Addressing hunger and food insecurity requires more than just providing meals; it involves cross-sectoral efforts to equip communities with the knowledge, skills, and resources to improve their livelihoods and well-being.Investing in education and vocational training can catalyse breaking the cycle of poverty and creating pathways to sustainable livelihoods.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Unleashing the Potential of Communities  Through Convergence  Host:  Civil society organisations, or CSOs, play a crucial role in fulfilling the basic needs of society  where governments or businesses have fallen short, such as providing healthcare and education  among many other services. But no single CSO has the resources to solve these issues  independently, which is why CSOs must use their networks to pool together expertise and  capabilities from various stakeholders, be they governments, businesses or communities.  To explore this further, we'll take a look at the Gawad Kalinga Community Development  Foundation, a Philippine-based CSO dedicated to eradicating poverty and restoring human  dignity since its formation in 2003. Gawad Kalinga is one of the world's leading volunteer-based  CSOs with over 5,000 volunteers that to date has provided land and shelter to more than  100,000 families in 3,000 communities throughout the Philippines.  Guided by the concept of 'Walang Iwanan' which translates to 'leave no one behind', their work  includes conducting community-based learning programmes for children, securing land and  building materials to construct homes for the poor, providing food to malnourished children and  pregnant mothers, and providing clean drinking water to poor communities. Beyond the  obvious advantages of such initiatives, there is also an often overlooked benefit leveraging the  untapped capacity for contribution within every individual.  Let's hear from Dan Bercasio, Gawad Kalinga's Executive Director about how convergence  platforms can unleash the latent potential within stakeholders.  Dan Bercasio:  We have a platform called Kusina Ng Kalinga, translated as Care Kitchen. Back in 2014, before  the pandemic hit, we were operating centralised kitchens mostly in partnership with the  government, wherein we provide healthy and warm meals to public school kids who are  
considered by the government or the schools as severely malnourished. So we were operating  around 160 kitchens serving around 100,000 kids before the pandemic.  But when the pandemic hit, since physical contact is limited and we could not really operate the  kitchens, we shifted towards community kitchens which also gave us an opportunity to  recognise the capacity of even the poor families or local volunteers to contribute in making sure  that hunger is addressed in their own locality in a bite-sized manner. So during the pandemic  and because of the pandemic, when the hunger rate shoot up, we were actually forced to  operate 460 plus community kitchens serving around 150 kids.  We're able to serve, I think around 6.5 million meals from the pandemic up to last year. The  magic is not on the meals but on how the local volunteers were able to contribute even in one  cup of rice or one kilo of vegetables or even their sweat and their volunteerism hours now give  us the opportunity to truly not put up kitchens, but put up convergence platforms. Because the  key is how to unleash also the heroism or how to spread not virus, but the hope among people.  So moving forward, we are positioning these community kitchens as convergence platforms  wherein we don't just feed kids. Our target is to serve 500,000 kids and serve 10 million meals  every day.  But the more important thing is, as a convergence platform, other players can come in, let's say,  to teach how to serve, how to teach the mothers how to produce or cook healthier meals from  local ingredients and also address the issue on health which is also driving poor families deeper  into poverty. There are approaches wherein we just have to address the behavioural and  nutritional aspects on health. And at the same time, in each community, we build community  farms, small community farms, where they start producing vegetables that they can cook in the  kitchen or they can bring home or share with other families.  Because the point is to bring back that culture of productivity instead of that mindset, hey, I  have, let's say, 100 pesos in my pocket, I'll go to the market and spend maybe 40 pesos to be  able to buy vegetables which I can actually plant in my backyard. So bringing that cultural  productivity is very important to us. So moving forward, we hope to address hunger by building  these collaboration platforms.  More importantly also, it's connecting these communities to the network of Gawad Kalinga,  wherein this is now on the deeper level of the GK work. We are in to the business of building  communities, organising communities and building movement or volunteerism base around this  
community, second. And the third is we also put up a school to produce young agri  entrepreneurs. It's a three month programme that is also accredited by the government,  wherein these kids or these youth from the poor communities, when they go back to their  communities, they could start their own community farms and then start producing food, but  not also producing food, but also earn from this endeavour.  Host:  Every member of an organisation or community has the potential to be a positive contributor to  society. The question is, how do we unlock that potential?  As Mr.Bercasio has shared, by facilitating what he calls 'convergence platforms', Gawad Kalinga  was able to circumvent the obstacles posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and continue providing  warm meals to the hungry, even at the height of lockdowns and social distancing.  Their pandemic response highlights the value of deeply understanding the motivations that  underlie stakeholder actions and how facilitating the enabling tools and environments can help  them to help themselves even without directive oversight.

Culture, Values, and Leadership in Decision-Making

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Hideaki Takahashi explored how leaders can effectively navigate complex cultural contexts and make decisions that foster trust, alignment, and collective purpose within their teams.Effective leadership requires recognising and seizing 'leadership moments'—key opportunities to build trust, foster alignment, and drive team cohesion.Leadership decisions must consider the cultural dynamics and values of individuals, teams, and the organisation, as these factors influence the reception and success of actions.Empathy ensures leaders connect deeply with their teams, making decisions that respect diverse motivations and foster cohesive dynamics.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Culture, Values, and Leadership in Decision-Making  Host:  Leadership often boils down to the decisions you make: when to adapt, when to push forward,  or when to step back. Each choice shapes the path ahead.  But, decisions aren’t always clear-cut, and knowing which path to take can be daunting.  The challenge here lies in recognising those pivotal junctures and ensuring your choices align  with core values and organisational culture.  To provide deeper insight into this very subject, we’re joined by former Deputy President of Fuji  Xerox and Keio University Professor, Hideaki Takahashi.  Professor Takahashi will explore how leaders can identify and seize these moments while  aligning their decisions with organisational culture and values.  Professor Hideaki Takahashi:  Leadership moment is a moment all of a sudden comes to your mind or my mind. "Wow, I have  to do something." Something for what? Something to change the course or gain speed or stop  it. That's the definition of the leadership moment. And in the majority of the cases that any  managers know one type of leadership movement that is to exercise their power. See, those  managers don't realise that's not the most effective way to capture the moment. That moment  actually comes much earlier than you really, you are jittery to step in.  It's about three minutes or five minutes earlier. What is it? It is, you have to inquire. What do  you think, Hide? "Wow, that's a great idea. Tell me more." You have to inquire them and pull  what they have inside.  And what is the definition of leadership? Leadership is to get the job done through all the  people, not you. Leaders and the leadership is different. Leader is a position name. Leadership is  
everybody. And the leader is obliged to make sure that everybody shows their leadership. A  good observant manager would know who might be a good starter.  So you know that person would appoint somebody. "Wow, what do you think of that?" Right?  And then something is said and that's going to spread to the others. Job done.  First, you know, I would say most important in the decision-making is understanding of the  values, understanding of culture. They are so much related because the basis of act in each of  the region and locale are coming from those values and beliefs. So if you don't understand and  send a text or email by SMS, that wouldn't do it unless you understand the culture and the  values.  So anyone who is going to do decision-making, remember that. One thing that's very important  is listening skills. What you have to do is go out and do a mission of trying to understand what  the local people are valuing what and etc.  See, those are much more difficult than asking people who are dealing with you in the  businesses. In the businesses, you are using the same words but you know, when you go out to  the locale and you know they are doing a totally different thing, you have no idea what they are  doing. Then you must show an inner interest in what they are doing and why. And they might  start, you know, share with you what is, you know, motivating them to continue doing it.  That's the skill, you know, that's required. I will use those skills going to the new company. So  this is used, you know, for the businesses but also doing very difficult jobs like downsizing. At  the end it's all people, people to people have to have empathy to be able to understand each  other. But it does require skills to get inside them and get what they are thinking and what  values.  The biggest element, as the geography I cover expands, is that cultural issues become such a key  importance. Why? Because culture is the main determination of the value system in each of the  locales. So unless we understand the culture for the recipients of the decision, we cannot make  a good decision. See, in many cases, the decision itself won't change, but how to deliver it will  be modified or softened or toughened.  I wouldn't think in the corporate world. In the United States there's quite a bit of diversity in  terms of CEOs etc. And I still think the decision methodologies quite similar. Very, very oriented  
towards quantifying the values, not only the money but also other ratios etc. Whereas for  Japan, many CEOs pass judgement on the qualities of those non-quantifiable stuff or put the  values on the intangibles.  Intangibles are important in some cultures. Unless you go out there and interact with these  young people not once, many times, you cannot deepen understanding of the culture and their  people. Curiosity is central in getting to know other people. If you show interest in other  cultures, the people from that culture will feel positive. If they ask me about Japanese culture, I  get warmed up. Yes. So that's the way to get to know each other.  Host:  As Professor Takahashi highlighted, leadership boils down to recognising and seizing the  ‘leadership moment’.  These are moments when leaders must build rapport, establish trust, and create alignment  within their teams.  It’s in these critical instances that decision-making requires a deep understanding of the cultural  context and core values of individuals, teams, and the organisation as a whole. The decisions  leaders make here not only drive outcomes but also reinforce shared purpose and cohesion.  By recognising these leadership moments, leaders can inspire collective action that is grounded  in values and attuned to the cultural dynamics at play.

Knowledge, Communication & Empathy: The Foundations of Effective Leadership

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Pial Khadilla introduced the fundamental qualities that form the basis of effective leadership, and how each can be harnessed.There are three fundamental qualities of effective leadership: Knowledge, Communication, and Empathy (KCE).Knowledge extends beyond gathering information; it involves connecting experiences and understanding broader contexts. Leaders should recognise what they don’t know and commit to continuous learning. Communication is more than clear expression; it’s about influencing, inspiring, and motivating. Effective leaders communicate thoughtfully, considering the impact of their words and fostering collaboration. Empathy means understanding others' perspectives and reflecting on how decisions affect them. Leaders build trust by being aware of their influence and respecting others’ time and effort.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Knowledge, Communication & Empathy: The Foundations  of Effective Leadership  Host:  There’s no shortage of opinions about what makes a great leader.  Just think of your own experiences;   it’s often easier to identify what doesn’t work than to  define what does.  Yet, certain qualities seem to stand out across impactful leaders, regardless of context. So what  are these quintessential leadership qualities?  Now, you’ll be introduced to the tenets of the Global Institute For Tomorrow’s (GIFT) proprietary  leadership fundamentals framework; Knowledge, Communication and Empathy.  As a leading pan-Asian think tank, GIFT has over two decades of experience providing leadership  development for Fortune 500 companies.  To shed more light on this subject, we’re joined by Pial Khadilla, Managing Director of GIFT,  ASEAN.  Pial will explore these core qualities and how each can be harnessed to unleash potential at  both the individual and organisational levels.  Pial Khadilla:  In the GIFT's narrative or the leadership pillars that we have, this concept of KCE, or knowledge,  communication and empathy. These three leadership values are actually the foundation. You  know, how do you move from performance day to day and then into the untapped potential?  
What we mean by the knowledge bit is really about having that global awareness to build a  much more expansive worldview. We can be a victim of our own biases, our own reference  points, and that all comes from the environment that we are in.  Culture, parents, teachers, friends. And it's very easy to live in this bubble. And so how do I  experience and understand about the wider world that we live in? And why is it important, for  example, having a deeper curiosity around different cultures, the different races, the religion, et  cetera, to understand how society functions as a result of the culture and the environment that  it lives in.  Being able to understand how the governance systems in a country affects the ways of how the  people   behave   and   operate.   So   being   able   to   have   this   expansive   worldview   is   really  understanding what I am consuming as information. And typically that's mainstream narrative,  right? Most people go to the same platforms to consume what we think the world is. And so  what that allows me is to just have more options on the table, more opportunities to consider  more perspectives to percolate on.  And as a leader, because, you know, things are changing at such a rapid scale, you can't know it  all either. So being able to empower your team and the rest of the organisation to be able to  build that level of knowledge is absolutely critical, because leaders can't know it all. So the best  way is to actually equip everyone in the organisation from the bottom all the way to the top and  expose them as much as possible and make it and inculcate it as a culture of the organisation to  encourage and empower them to learn things beyond their day to day or their BAU. You know,  so just really expanding ‘self’ in many different ways because everything is interconnected.  Maybe I'll start off by framing that communication is probably one of the most cited areas that  professionals or leaders will mention in terms of the areas that they want to improve upon.  There are many different theories out there about communication, but I think communication  in its most simplest, raw form is just this act of being able to engage with another. But  communication actually is a range of different skill sets, right?  It embodies the intention, how the other person perceives you, and it also embodies the  outcome of the dialogue that's just taken place and what happens after is the precursor of the  action. So therefore, communication is not just within that realm of presentation, of giving  instructions, of delegation, but really is a tool for ideas to form, take shape, grow. It's a form of  being able to get people excited. How can leaders inspire? How can leaders motivate its team?  Sometimes, you know, people don't understand that in order for us to be able to communicate  
in ways that touch another, you have to bring this level of energy, to bring this level of  authenticity, sincerity, genuinity, and also the ability to move another through stories, right?  So people feel that it's relatable. People can think and see like, oh, this is how it impacts me. I've  seen this happening before, Have I experienced it before? I absolutely understand what you're  saying and I, and I believe in that vision and I believe in that mission and I want to be a part of it.  And that's what communication is actually meant to do.  And so if I have actually been able to plant something in the other person to consider what I  have just said, or to even perhaps expand their range of understanding and to invite them to be  able to consider a different perspective, then I have done a good job. That is what you want to  be able to do in your communication.  Empathy is the core strength for a person to have because what it does in relationships is that it  moves   a   relationship   from   one   that   is   transactional into one that is relational. And in  organisations it's so easy to fall into that transactional relationship, right?  This is a timeline, this is a due date, let's get it done. And you know, at first to kind of like get  things done in a very fast manner that could work. But over time the lack of empathy means  that there is a lack of care. And when people start feeling that the organisation doesn't really  care about me, then what is the point of me caring then that's how people start to get  disconnected or disengaged from the organisation. They start to check out. And you have terms  of phenomenon such as quiet quitting, for example, because that lack of empathy. So I would  say in a leadership context, why it is really important because it makes one feel significant,  makes one feel heard and seen.  An individual will need to start with the self. A lot of times I do feel that people lack in self-love,  lack in self-respect, lack in extending that care for myself and therefore unable to extend that to  others. So that's probably like the first place that I would start that change and understanding,  giving grace to self. And then how are we able to then extend that into okay, I have gone  through certain difficulties, that person is going through certain difficulties. It might not be the  same, it's different, but how can I be present?  
Host:  As Pial shared, three core qualities form the foundations of effective leadership: Knowledge,  Communication, and Empathy (KCE).  Knowledge isn’t just about gathering information; it’s about connecting issues, experiences, and  contexts to shape a broader perspective. Effective leaders are open to what they don’t know  and explore beyond their industry.  Since no leader can know it all, it’s vital to empower the entire organisation with a culture of  continuous learning, encouraging everyone to expand beyond their usual roles.  Communication is more than just clear expression; it’s about creating meaningful influence.  Effective communication drives action, shapes perspectives, and strengthens relationships.  Great leaders not only articulate ideas thoughtfully but also consider the impact of their words  on others. Whether it’s presenting ideas, running meetings, or navigating cultural differences,  they communicate with the intent to inspire, motivate, and foster collaboration.  Empathy involves truly understanding others’ experiences. It’s not just recognising different  perspectives but reflecting on the impact of decisions. Leaders build trust by being aware of  their influence and respecting others’ time, effort, and opinions.  By embodying these qualities, leaders can drive personal growth and organisational success.

Resilient Governments: Mechanisms for a Plural World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong outlined three mechanisms for enhancing governance in an increasingly complex and plural world, emphasising the need for government adaptability and inclusivity.Effective governance requires collaboration between government and non-governmental institutions, recognising the spectrum of involvement between state authorities and non-state actors, as well as overlap in resources, personnel, and decision-making processes.Public sector humility is essential, particularly in acknowledging the limits of governmental knowledge and deferring to the expertise of technocrats. This approach allows for more informed and effective decision-making, especially in areas like public health and climate change.Bridging geopolitical polarisation and fragmentation is critical for fostering international cooperation. By seeking common ground and promoting dialogue, governments can enhance collaboration on global challenges.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Resilient Governments: Mechanisms for a Plural World  Host:  Most of the institutions and frameworks we've established to ensure good governance have been predicated on the dynamics of a unipolar world.  While the guiding principles of good governance will remain, the mechanisms to achieve them must evolve in an increasingly complex and plural world.  To   provide   us   with   three   mechanisms   for   enhancing   governance   in   this   diverse   and interconnected landscape, we have renowned political theorist and geopolitical strategist, Dr. Brian Wong.  An expert in the study of ethics and politics, Dr Wong will share his perspective on the essential steps needed to adapt our governance models to today's realities.  Dr. Brian Wong:  How can governments around the world work with different sets of institutions and actors in realising sound governance? The first is, I think it's vital that we dismantle this artificial distinction between government and non-governmental institutions.  Many   governments   around   the   world   regularly   engage   with   NGOs   and   non-profits and corporations. Many non-profits around the world regularly lobby and also speak with and interlocute with governmental counterparts. It is not the case that ultimately the two can be separated or rather discerned from one another. And instead there's often a lot of overlap between them. Overlap in personnel, overlap in resources, overlap in the decision-making processes. So rather than seeing this sort of NGO versus GO cut as a hard and fast rule, what I'd propose instead is to think about how, you know, there's a spectrum.  There's a spectrum of degrees of involvement of state authorities and non-state apparatus and organs at large. And what we're really doing here is to find out the right balance and range on  
the spectrum that works for a particular context. In some societies, we might have to lean more towards the private sector because the government is overburdened by bureaucraticism, by red tape, and also captured by the political elite.  In   some   other   societies,   the   failure   of   state   intervention   could   well   breed   the rise of unsustainable   duopolies, oligopolies, and also market structures that lead to devastating consequences when it comes to public goods because of price gouging, but also other forms of exclusionary practices adopted by companies. There's no hard and fast rule here. We need to shift the window as the context and problem presents itself, so on and so forth.  But secondly, humility is also vital on a part of those partaking in public service. Humility, you know, in the modern era there's a tendency to sort of talk ourselves up, right? To position ourselves as experts in everything. Or better yet, right, as some would call it, let's reject the experts, let's do away with experts.  Okay, no more hockey stick graphs. There's no climate change, according to some in the Republican Party *cough or alternatively some others would say, well, you know, the Earth is flat and we should go along with that. And still even in less extreme cases, post-structuralist or whatever you call it, different accounts of radical theories of truth would say there's no objective truth.  Let's do away with experts. We know it all because we've lived through it. We have lived experiences. This is not a straw man. I wish it were a straw man, but this is not a straw man of dangerous tendencies we see in advanced liberal democracies but also in non-democracies alike.  What is needed here is, in my humble opinion, a healthy dosage of humility, of acceptance on a part of especially government officials and politicians that there are things that they don't know, and that they're things that they should not try to know, and that ultimately the things that they should let others do the talking and knowing and investigating and reflections over such as of course, the botched response of say, the UK government to the COVID pandemic.  Had Whitty and Vallance, these lead advisors of the British government, been more seriously listened to and granted more power, perhaps the UK could have avoided many of the worst excesses of the devastating havoc wrought by the pandemic at large. Had there been more deference to those with the actual expertise and knowledge, maybe we would not have ended up with, you know, the collapse of SVB or now we've got the First Republic, another bank  
collapsing, so on and so forth. So what I'm trying to say here is that experts sometimes do know better and it's vital that non-experts stay humble and listen. Listen to those that have been warning us all along about climate change. Listen to those in civil society that have toiled tirelessly away at tackling developmental bottlenecks and inequalities. Listen as opposed to preach, as opposed to proselytise.  And the third mechanism of change, and this is the final point I want to make here is, is bridging both within the political elites and the political scene at large, but also between those in positions of governmental power and those outside. We're witnessing increasing distancing, polarisation. And as a result of that, vindictive resentment, right? From one party or multiple parties towards one another, the world as we know it is becoming more fragmented than everyone and always living in siloed echo chambers. This proves to be a major obstacle to cooperation.  Internationally, Sino-American strategic rivalry has certainly thrown a spanner into the works of a) nuclear containment and preventing the escalation of geopolitical conflict to a nuclear war even I don't think it's likely just yet. b) It's also hindered climate change cooperation. Taking solar panel as a case in point, talk of friend-shoring and nearshoring is merely concealing the fact that solar panels now produced for American consumption and also other strategically sensitive and important renewable energy supplies that are being subsidised under the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, are still heaps and heaps more expensive than in a counterfactual world where they were predominantly sourced from China.  So this paranoia concerning supply chains does not do us any favours when it comes to tackling climate change and resolving, you know, these global challenges. And above all, if you look at how the COVID pandemic has been politicised, and that's not just from the American side and the Western side, it's also from this side of the world, right, where everyone and all's attempt to craft conjectures and speculative allegations concerning who started COVID.  It's not helpful because that is precisely what creates the confidence of those who otherwise, you   know,   would   potentially   be   open   to   collaborating   over   international   public   health investigation and research. So internationally, polarisation does us no good. We need to seek to bridge and depolarise.  
Host:  Dr. Wong illustrated what he feels are three crucial mechanisms for achieving good governance in our increasingly plural world.  Firstly,   is   to   begin   dismantling   the   artificial   distinctions   between   government   and non-governmental institutions. Governments frequently collaborate with NGOs, nonprofits, and corporations. Recognizing the spectrum of involvement between state authorities and non-state actors is crucial, as this overlap in personnel, resources, and decision-making processes reflects the reality of modern governance.  Secondly,   is   the   need for public sector humility in acknowledging the limits of its own knowledge and deferring to the expertise of technocrats, particularly in fields like public health and climate change. Humility allows for more informed and effective decision-making by ensuring that those with specialised knowledge and experience are heard and their insights are integrated into policy decisions.  Lastly, bridging the divides of geopolitical polarisation and fragmentation which only hinder collaboration and exacerbate conflicts. By seeking common ground and promoting dialogue, we can enhance international cooperation and tackle pressing global issues more effectively.

Defining Good Governance

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong defined the essential components of good governance, emphasising that governments must be evaluated on multiple fronts to be accountable to their people.Results are the first component of good governance, measured by the government's ability to deliver substantive outcomes that improve the wellbeing of its citizens. However, specific priorities may vary depending on the societal context and the unique needs of different populations.Perception is the second component of good governance, as governments must be perceived as legitimate and just by the people to effectively maintain social stability and citizen engagement. Governments must foster a sense of trust and satisfaction among their citizens, ensuring that they feel represented and heard.Inclusion is the third component of good governance, whereby governments must incorporate the voices of citizens, across all layers of society, in the decision-making process. Ensuring that people have a say in shaping the policies that affect their lives is fundamental to creating a fair, representative and responsive government.

TRANSCRIPT  Defining Good Governance  Host:  Good governance is a cornerstone of any functioning society but what exactly does that entail?  'Good' is a relative term, and what constitutes good governance will vary from country to country for a range of reasons, such as cultural values, historical contexts, and societal priorities.  How then does one define exactly how good a system of governance is? This isn't a question of whether a nation is democratic or communist but rather how well it serves its people and addresses their needs.  Now to talk us through a practical definition of good governance in the 21st century, we’re joined by renowned political theorist and geopolitical strategist, Dr. Brian Wong.  An expert in the study of ethics and politics, Dr. Wong will break down the components of good governance, as he sees it.  Dr. Brian Wong:  What I want to just suggest here is that maybe sound governance must be decomposed into three, arguably irreducible, even though they are causally interlinked components concerning governance. And the first is, is governance effective at delivering results? Okay?  The second is, is a governance perceived to be effective at delivering results or in general a good form of governance? The third is, is the governance procedurally inclusive and just?  These three questions are interrelated, but they can't be collapsed or subsumed right into one another. And I fear that what we see today is that there's a tendency to collapse them all, when that's in fact not a justifiable move at large. Let me just break down, you know, explain what each of these components constitutes.  
The first component concerning if the government is effective at delivering results, revolves largely   around   the   substantive   outcomes   that   follow   from,   say,   government.   Can   the government improve material well-being? Do they make the people better off and alleviate poverty and ameliorate inequalities?  Are they capable of maintaining security and social stability, building the necessary requisite infrastructure, and advancing development? These are all goods that I wouldn't say all, but 99% of people around the world want. Where they differ of course, is the weightings and the weightages they assigned to each of these goods.  So some countries or some peoples within certain countries may say, I would prefer freedom and I prefer the sentiment of freedom as a deliverable over security. I don't really care about security. In some other countries, I might say I want an end to poverty. That's my first and foremost priority for my society.  And in fact I want my poverty situation to be, you know, alleviated, right? And that is in turn what   guides   my   judgement   of   what   the   substantive   looks   like.   All   of   these   are   fair interpretations, all of these are valid judgments. And this is where it's important to note that what the government can substantively deliver is important, but is also context dependent.  People who crave environmental protection, right? Say tribes or indigenous folks who see that the preservation of the environment is sacrosanct and a paramount objective are likely to weigh environmental stabilisation and also preservation slash restoration way, way, way, way, way above occupational diversity.  Whereas if you're living in, say, the countryside, in a rural region of an economy that struggled and been sluggish for the past 40 years due to globalisation, you might say getting a job reduces and minimises unemployment, that's way more important than protecting the environment, right? So different folks have different prerogatives and preferences and understandably, the governments who can best satisfy their people's demands is a government that can most substantively deliver.  Second criterion, perception. The government cannot just be just or sound at large. It must also be seen as just and sound, right? So some would say this is PR, others would say this is spin. But in my humble opinion, it is a very valid and important criterion of good governance that the people feel that this is a good government. Sure, you could argue that some folks might be  
brainwashed   or   others   might   be   entrapped   by   propaganda,   or that still they might be manipulated by dishonest, okay, feel-good rhetoric propagated by the government. But what we need to remember at the end of the day is that the quality of life of an individual is plural and has an inevitably subjective component.  It's not just an objective game of, ooh, are you, you know, able to earn, I don't know, this arbitrary number when it comes to US dollars per month, or do you have such purchasing power? All of that's nice, but ultimately it needs to reflect in terms of the theory of well-being of citizens, right?  It needs to reflect a subjective component of are they happy? Are they happy about the government? Do they feel that the government is an authorised representative and delegate acting on their behalf? Or did he instead think that living under a terrible oppressive state that no one really could buy into or opt out of?  So perceptual legitimacy and soundness is equally important. And there are governments that score very highly on a perceptual dimension, but not so much on the actual front. Right? So these are governments that often leverage in an incredibly good spin and also propaganda, alternatively publicity work in order to achieve their own ends.  And then they're governments that deliver very well, but are terrible at public relations, especially in relation to the outside world. These governments exist all over the world and it's vital to highlight and recognise that two dimensions don't come hand in hand. And the final dimension of sound governance is procedural inclusivity.  And this is where historically the most pure and, I suppose, orthodox theories of direct democracy score the most highly in. Even though I would, you know, I would challenge anyone listening here to find me an example of direct democracy that does work in a status quo in a modern   era,   given   the   vastness and largeness of populations, but also the difficulty of coordination there, maybe blockchain could come to the rescue.  Anyway, that's an aside, but it's worth noting that procedurally speaking, the government must also deliver for the people by allowing individuals to take part in a decision-making process, right? And the intuition pump for this is quite straightforward. If you're raised in a family where you're given very nice food and you feel that your parents, you know, you owe everything to your parents and yet there's something still not quite right about it, right?  
And that is that you don't feel that you're being listened to, that you don't have an input, you don't have a say in that decision-making process concerning what food you get in morning, at lunch and at night. It just happens to be that you really like the food your parents give you, then chances are this is a bit of a dysfunctional household as well.  But because you're not involved in partaking in the processes and also the procedures that generate the goods you're now enjoying. So a sound government must also include its people in some sense, in some ways not necessarily direct elections or, you know, vote-based systems. It could   also   be   consultative   hierarchies,   alternatively   committees of, you know, local and communal participation that get you involved in some semblance of governance. But one way or the other, it's vital that there's a fair and also inclusive procedure determining the outcomes as opposed to, you know, relying upon the arbitrary whims of effectively a gentle giant, to borrow from Pettit’s analogy there.  Anyhow, all of this is to say sound governance is plural. There's no one single criterion as to what good governance is, and there's no one single sort of Hail Mary or, you know, checkbox that once you tick it, voilà– that is good governance. That's not how governance works and it's vital that we recognise it as such.  What this therefore means, by the way, is that a push for democratisation in countries may well, but also may well not be aligned with good governance. In some contexts, democracy is probably ideal. Democracy in an electorally driven and rooted sense and fashion is plausibly better than an unaccountable dictator making arbitrary decisions in accordance with the beliefs and principles of a military.  But in some other cases, the drive towards democracy may not yield the most instrumentally and substantively good outcomes for the people. It may not generate a satisfied population because of the inherent divisions and cleavages within the power system, but also because ultimately, in a drive for everyone having the right to vote, what's often neglected and forgotten here is for what on what metrics and with what intents and purposes do people vote?  Do they vote to kill off the other side? Do they vote to beat the minority? Do they vote in order to perpetrate the tyranny of the majority? Or do they vote instead for communal well-being and for the benefit of the society at large? I mean, the answer is pretty clear and you know the writings on a wall in many of these flawed democracies that we regrettably see around the world today.  
And last but not least, one further note on democratisation. Even if we were to grant that democracy is an ideal mode of governance across most cases, let's not bundle that up with a question of how we're achieving that democracy. Right?  And if the means of democratisation is violent, rooted in coup, driven by the military, or both, propelled effectively by an unaccountable elite right who seeks to be revolutionary for the sake of   their   own   interests,   then   chances   are   you're   not   going   to   get   genuine   authentic democratisation. You're going to get fragile, tentative and tenuous democratisation that ends in tendentious tragedy.  Host:  As Dr. Wong puts it, three interconnected but distinct components define good governance: Results, Perception, and Inclusivity.  Results refer to the effectiveness of governance—its ability to deliver tangible outcomes that improve the wellbeing of its citizens. This includes alleviating poverty, maintaining security, and advancing development.  Secondly, the perception of governance is just as important as its actual performance. A government must not only be effective but also be seen as legitimate and just by its people.  Thirdly, inclusivity. Good governance must involve the people in the decision-making processes, allowing for all segments of society to have a say in shaping the policies that affect their lives.  But as Dr. Wong highlighted, good governance is not exclusive to any single form of government. Whether   a nation is democratic or authoritarian, capitalist or socialist, the principles of effectiveness, perception, and inclusivity can and should be applied to create a system that serves its people well.

Navigating Organisational Transformation & Disruption

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong delved into the interplay between transformation and disruption, and the importance of overcoming the fear of failure to drive continuous innovation within organisations. Transformation is inherently disruptive and requires organisations to challenge the status quo, which can cause discomfort. This disruption is necessary for innovation and creating new revenue streams. The fear of failure is a major barrier to successful transformation, both at the institutional and personal levels. While operational failures (unnecessary errors in routine tasks) should be avoided, experimental failures (errors while pursuing untested ideas) are valuable learning opportunities. Transformation is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of reinvention. To stay competitive, organisations must continuously adapt and innovate.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Navigating Organisational Transformation & Disruption  Host:  Transformation is essential for organisations to stay competitive.  But by definition, transformation brings with it a certain degree of disruption, whether it’s to  existing processes, technologies, or ways of thinking.  This can be unsettling, sometimes even immobilising, as it challenges established norms and  introduces the risk of failure—something few organisations can afford to ignore.  So, how do we navigate the imperative for transformation alongside the certainty of disruption?  To explore this critical question, we’re joined by Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed.  Dan is the former VP at Samsung's Media Solutions Center, and previously served as Nokia's VP  of Services and Software, where he led the company's feature-phone to smartphone  transformation in its largest global market.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University’s Antai School of Business,  where he teaches a course on AI and Product Innovation.  Dan Wong:  Does transformation have to be disruptive? That's a very tough question, but the short answer  is yes. The reason why it's a tough question is that disruption itself is a confusing topic. On the  one hand, we need to create the types of products and services that actually disrupt the market  to create the opportunities for us to then build a new revenue stream.  But in order to do so, it requires organisations and individuals to change the way they think and  the way they operate. To the extent that we are trying to do something new. This automatically  means that there will be some level of discomfort.  
There's a common question that many ask that's almost become a business slogan, which is  "Disrupt yourself". And the question really then becomes to all of us, can we actually disrupt  ourselves? Because that's at the core of successful transformation. But here's the crux as well.  If you don't transform, you've actually made a decision. You've made a decision to allow outside  forces that you have no influence on to disrupt you.  What is so disruptive about disruption? And this really goes to the institutional fear of failure  that exists within organisations. And the key, of course, to successful transformation is  somehow overcoming that institutional fear. And have no doubt, the institutional fear goes very,  very deep.  There are many organisations, including in my time doing digital transformation for three  organisations over 10 years, organisations always say, please go ahead and fail. And this is easy  to say, but very often very difficult to do within organisations with that kind of a legacy  background. But that is the core area to overcome in terms of transformation.  Now, how do we think about overcoming failure? Is all failure good? And it's very important  then, as you try to overcome that fear, failure to understand there are actually two types of  failure, and this is in the words of Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon. What are these two types of  failures? One is actually Operational failure, the other is Experimental failure. Operational  failure is the failure you want to avoid. What that really means is that you're actually failing on  something you should know about.  For example, in the case of Amazon, they have lots of experience building fulfilment centres.  Hundreds and hundreds of fulfilment centres. Actually, you should not fail when you build a  new one, you already know how to do that. So this type of failure is something to be avoided.  And even though you're going through transformation and doing new things, this type of failure  we need to avoid.  The other type of failure is called experimental failure. You're actually trying something different  on purpose. You're trying a new product or service or a new approach. This is an area where  you have no guidelines, you have no previous express to inform you. Actually, you don't know  how to do that. And if you clearly classify that, then this is the way forward. So the experimental  failure is the one to encourage. But if you do fail, you have a system in place to actually capture  that learning and apply it in the next one.  
Even Amazon, if we were to extend our analogy here, even Amazon has had many failures. You  know, one failure, for example, is the Amazon Fire phone. There's a period of time that Amazon  was creating user devices, you know, and the phone came up with great fanfare but did not do  well. But the crux here is this. Amazon didn't just give up on consumer devices, they keep  evolving and they took the learning from that failed experiment and applied to other product  categories. That is the right way of failure. This is the type of failure that we're actually actively  looking for.  So what do we take away from all this discussion? Transformation is by definition disruptive.  There's no way around that. Unfortunately, knowing about this situation doesn't make it less  disruptive and less uncomfortable. And it is the nature of the beast. To successfully navigate  transformation really is two things. It's overcoming two levels of fear. The first level of fear to  overcome is an organisational sense of fear. This is the system level topics that we talked about  today.  But there's a second one as well. And this is the personal level, your personal aversion to failure.  And this comes back to the fact that it's very often easy to say accepting failure, but when it  comes to yourself, can you accept it? Because you know that in this pathway of new innovation  there will be failures.  But that is not all. There's a final piece here as well. In terms of the takeaway you need to make  sure the environment exists by having a system documented right with the different KPIs, a way  to capture the learnings, to then expand and then make the transformation. An area that is an  ongoing capability, not a project-by-project capability. Something that is built into the  capabilities, expectations of an organisation. Transformation, it's not 1, 2, 3 phases. It's an  ongoing search to reinvent your business and at the core of that is the organisational  expectations and the environment by which this type of innovation can flourish.  To those companies that can navigate this smoothly, the rewards can be very big, especially in  today's rapidly changing world. To those that are unable to move forward, you're much more  subjected to the changes in the environment and the trends that are happening all around us.  
Host:  As Dan illustrated, transformation is inherently disruptive and requires organisations to  challenge the status quo, a process that often leads to discomfort. The fear of failure, whether  at an institutional or personal level, is one of the greatest barriers to successful transformation.  This disruption, however, is a necessary catalyst for innovation and the creation of new revenue  streams.  To navigate this challenge effectively, organisations must make clear distinctions between  operational failures - avoidable errors in routine tasks that should be minimised - and  experimental failures, which are valuable learning opportunities that arise from trying untested  ideas.  Embracing these experimental failures is key to fostering innovation and ensuring continuous  growth. Companies that can balance the discomfort of change with the pursuit of new  opportunities will be better positioned to thrive in the future.

Pathways to A Resilient Multipolar Order

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dr. Brian Wong outlines two key pathways - distribution and recognition - that could serve as essential strategies for building a resilient multipolar world order capable of addressing global challenges more effectively.Addressing distributive disparities in resources, opportunities, and power is key to a resilient multipolar world. This means fairer access to vital resources and technologies for poorer nations and ensuring the benefits of growth and innovation are shared where possible. However, redistribution should be sustainable and correct imbalances without stifling innovation or private ownership.Improving the recognition of minority and disenfranchised voices is crucial for a resilient multipolar world as it reduces mistrust between societies and promotes global cooperation. This means addressing historical grievances, dismantling prejudices, and integrating diverse perspectives into global decision-making processes.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Pathways to A Resilient Multipolar Order  Host:  The unipolar world order is shifting, in no small part due to its vulnerability to global challenges  like climate change, economic inequality, and geopolitical conflicts.  As we move towards a multipolar world order, it's imperative that this new paradigm is able to  address these challenges better than its predecessor.  So how do we reach a more resilient multipolar order?  Here to provide us with two conceptual pathways to achieve this goal is renowned political  theorist and geopolitical strategist, Dr. Brian Wong.  An expert in the study of ethics and politics, Dr Wong will illustrate why distribution and  recognition are the paths to a resilient multipolar world.  Dr. Brian Wong:  The first is the distributive question. There's a deep skew, so to speak, in the overarching curve  of income and wealth distribution. Resources are not symmetrically allocated, from vaccines  and medical supplies at times of pandemics, to natural minerals and energy, and also the  capacity to process them, by the way, right?  You know, coincidentally, Bolivia has the world's largest lithium supply, but it is nowhere near  the top 10 processors and manufacturers of lithium-related products. So that gives you some  food for thought, right? These are all instances of resource inequities and inequalities that  engender and bolster many of the aforementioned obstacles and also pitfalls that prevent us  from having a fair and inclusive global order.  The solution remedy, of course, isn't just flat equality, right? Because that also leaves its own  problem. It over-concentrates in the hands of those who are engaging in redistribution. It leads  
to or deters innovation, it sabotages private ownership, which I'd like to think is a pretty fair  institution at its core. But at the end of the day, we need to tip the balance back towards the  middle.  And at the moment, it's gone too far in one end. So what I'm advocating here isn't radical  redistribution. It's merely more redistribution in our processionally and structurally dependable  manner that is fair, that is inclusive, and that allows for the poor and impoverished nations to be  granted access not just to vital strategic resources that are very much needed in maintaining the  quality of life of their own citizens, but also, more importantly, the ropes to climb the ladder, the  innovation, the knowledge, the status quo patented technologies that deny and shut out the  Global South from their fair share at growth.  And last, not least, of course, and this might sound a tad extreme or radical to your ears, but I  would say, in fact, foreign nations also deserve a certain quota of a right to pollute. Not because  pollution is a de facto good, but because, you know, fundamentally the arguments that  developing countries do not deserve anywhere near the same level of latitude and privilege that  now developed economies had 150 years ago. That structure is pretty absurd as a thought,  right?  To say that, well, I'm sorry, because you've started developing 150 years later, you don't deserve  to pollute, whereas I could have and I still can pollute. Too bad. That narrative is inherently  exclusionary. So that's prong number one concerning how change can come about.  The second prong I'd like to highlight though is beyond distribution. There's the recognition  problem. And recognition, to borrow from one of my favourite sociologists, Axel Honneth, is  ultimately a question that requires our taking seriously, you know, how individual participants  feel, how individual participants’ agency is interacting with the structures in which they're  situated.  And in less abstract terms, basically, are my cultural freedoms and my freedoms to be who I am  and who I truly want to be, are they respected by the world at large? And from practises of  cultural appropriation to, you know, belittling and frankly infantilising narratives about persons  of colour propagated by, you know, none other than old white bigots in positions of influence,  to the designation of certain knowledge systems as rogue or wrong and other knowledge  systems as correct.  
These are all manifest instances where there are recognition inequalities in a world we live in  today. And this in turn has two deleterious effects. One, it shuts out people from systems of  global governance. It leaves them feeling isolated, alienated and ultimately ignored. And that  doesn't feel good.  So when folks complain about say, the Global south reaction to the Ukraine war or the allegedly,  you know, neutral stance and why they are neutral, it's important to bear in mind as much as,  you know, abhorrence and atrocities must be called out, the Global South is merely reacting in  accordance with what they take to be their interests and rightful grievances towards the past  decades, if not centuries of erasure and non-recognition by the powers that be.  And the second consequence as how this thwarts global cooperation is it heightens mistrust  between societies. It leads to certain countries' populations becoming ultra-nationalistic and  revisionist, even, as a means of expressing their grievances and frustrations at long standing  subjugation or exclusion from the recognition order.  Not going to name any particular names here, but we can see trends of rising nationalism, of  rising xenophobia and an attempt to decouple from both developed and developing countries  alike precisely because the people residing within don't feel recognised. The white working class  that's been displaced by mechanisation and also to a lesser extent globalisation, living in the  Rust Belt states, they don't feel recognised, they don't feel heard.  The Brexit voter doesn't feel heard by the European elite living in Brussels. Or indeed those who  believe firmly in staunch orthodox nationalism, Hindu nationalism in India also feel, right, in  their   eyes, a Congress-led structure and establishment had perennially perpetrated their  exclusion from recognition. So in order to tackle mistrust between societies, we need to  improve the recognition of minority and also disenfranchised voices.  Host:  We’ve learned of two conceptual pathways to achieving a resilient multipolar world order:  distribution and recognition.  Distribution addresses the crucial need to equitably allocate resources, opportunities, and  power across nations. By ensuring that the benefits of global growth and innovation are shared  more evenly, we can mitigate the stark inequalities that have historically hindered global  cooperation.  
But as Dr. Wong emphasises this does not mean radical redistribution but rather a fairer and  more sustainable approach that corrects imbalances and fosters global stability.  Recognition on the other hand focuses on acknowledging the diverse identities, cultures, and  contributions of all global participants. By valuing these cultural and social dimensions, we can  foster a global community where every nation and its people feel seen, heard, and respected.  This   means   addressing   historical   grievances,   dismantling   prejudices,   and   creating   an  environment where diverse perspectives are integrated into global decision-making processes.

Defining Fair & Inclusive International Relations

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dr Brian Wong shared his definitions of fairness and inclusivity in the context of international relations, emphasising the need for a more inclusive world order that addresses historical and systemic inequities.Historically, the nature of international relations has been parochial, limited by narratives of national exceptionalism that ultimately hinder true global cooperation by “othering” different groups.Inclusive international relations entail recognising the differences present across all nations, while also acknowledging and compensating for injustices stemming from historical and contemporary inequities.Fair international relations entail more than just inclusive participation and necessitate robust institutions that ensure equitable decision-making processes between and within countries, which help give a platform to marginalised voices.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Defining Fair & Inclusive International Relations  Host:  It's safe to say that most people agree the principles of fairness and inclusivity should be tenets  of international relations, particularly in our current geopolitical landscape.  Yet, many struggle to define what these terms mean in practice.  Without clear definitions guiding our principles, we risk fostering idealistic notions that sound  great on paper but don't hold up in the real world.  So to help provide us with the vocabulary to articulate these principles, we're joined by  renowned political theorist and geopolitical strategist Dr. Brian Wong.  An expert in the study of ethics and politics, Dr Wong will now share his definition of a fair and  inclusive international relations paradigm and explore the complexities involved in achieving it.  Dr. Brian Wong:  When it comes to an inclusive world or way of looking at the world at large, it's vital to  remember that throughout vast swathes of our history, the ways in which different countries or  different civilisations at large have sought to understand international relations is often quite  parochial. And that doesn't just stem from the sort of post-Westphalian order in Europe, in the  US and the UK, where there's often been this narrative centred around, you know, the Western  values of democracy, of freedom, of civilisation, prior to that, which obviously are parochial  insofar as they are couched and rooted deeply in the interests of one small select fragment of  the vast population of the world.  And this applies to non-Western civilisations as well. So I want to be very clear here that  international relations, at least throughout history, has struggled as a discipline, not just  because of Western colonialism and imperialist tendencies, but also because of the inward  looking and also largely nativist tendencies of civilisations elsewhere.  
And the same could be said of the Indian subcontinent. You know, the richness of its histories  and   the   depth   of   individual   principalities   and   also   kingdoms   obviously   rendered   the  subcontinent a fascinating place to study for international relations history. And yet the flip side  to that as well is that there hasn't or hadn't historically been much thinking about the world  beyond the subcontinent, beyond sort of western borders of, you know, what is now Pakistan or  the eastern borders of Nepal, so on and so forth.  So this sort of provincialised regionalism had been a historical phenomenon. And it's all the  more important that we try to tackle it, especially given, right, that these sentiments and their  percolation till this very day have led to the likes of unwarranted foreign invasions by, say,  America or an American led order in the Middle East, or alternatively the Soviet Union in  relation to Eastern and Central Europe during the Cold War, in proxy wars, so on and so forth.  These are all instances where a non-inclusive international relations theory is dangerous and  devastating. So the step number one to tackling the inequities we see today is, in my humble  opinion, to broaden the world order to include precisely different countries that may not be  proximate to your own, may not see eye to eye with yourselves in terms of values, may not be,  you know, fundamentally similar in a way they're constituted or governed, and yet it's important  to recognise their voices.  And that applies to, of course, giving the Global South more than what's already been given to  them in the status quo, which is very little, as well as acknowledging that between a Global  North and South and within each of these camps there exists a wide range of heterogeneities,  that is to say, differences, diversity and also cultural pluralism that need to be reflected in a way  institutions are shaped, whether it be in reallocating or rejigging voting weights, in granting  special protected voices and status to countries that are disproportionately affected by certain  global issues like climate change and rising sea levels and also floods and irregular weather  patterns, or even just right.  I don't think personally that the term reparations ought to be out of bounds or to be seen as  taboo, because in truth, many countries in the world do owe others, those that they pillaged,  plundered and exploited in the past, some sort of reparation, compensation and apology. So the  step one to this sort of dualistic framework is to make the world more inclusive. All of these  steps, and then some must be undertaken.  
Having established that, then we need to ask, what does fairness entail, right? Because in  theory, you could imagine an assembly, a general assembly, where you have, say, all countries  on earth represented. Everyone gets a say, very inclusive, and they all get to take part in the  decision-making procedures. And yet the system could still hypothetically remain unfair.  And why is that?  It could be because the rules used to filter and process the inputs from different countries are  fundamentally skewed. They are not reflective of reasonable justification, okay? Alternatively,  the justification, the rationale used by them is rooted in again, the dangerous parochialism that  I highlighted just then, the sort of belief in a civilisation myth, or the argument that you should  have suzerainty, they should show their respect to dominant and central powers.  These are misinformed and unfair myths that unduly render inclusive institutions unfair in the  arbitrariness and also asymmetry in how these judgments and decisions are made. It's not  enough for us to have, you know, institutions, have everyone involved, and that everyone gets  an equal say, and also equal ability to partake in it. That's a minimum necessity, but it's not  sufficient.  On top of that, we also need more robust institutions to ensure fairness between countries in  how decisions are made. But also, and this is crucial within countries, the voices of citizens  within each and every one of these individual countries must be fairly channeled, right?  And one of the primary reasons why the world has struggled so much with overconsumption as  well as this depletion-driven campaign of resource usage is precisely because the victims that  suffer under overconsumption, over-depletion and environmental degradation, they don't really  have a say. They don't really get to have this state and political participatory token that enables  them to influence how decisions are made in the corridors of power. So we want a fair world at  large.  We need to start with fair countries. And with fair countries, the prerequisite is fair cities. And  that is why we just zero in on the concept of designing a city for our future. It's not good enough  that they have environmentally robust and sustainable architecture. That's good, but that's not  good enough, right?  What's needed here too is direct mechanisms by which their people can have their voices  heard, can hold the elite accountable, and fundamentally have an opportunity to partake in the  
designing of the rules, of the institutions and of the outlines and the outlaying sort of  overarching structures of the cities. And therefore we move from cities to countries and  countries to the world at large.  Host:  If international relations is to address geopolitical challenges, it must be based on the principles  of fairness and inclusivity.  Inclusive international relations should broaden the world order to include those it presently  overlooks. The plurality of humanity must be reflected in its structures to have a system that is  truly representative of diverse perspectives and experiences.  A fair international relations paradigm, on the other hand, would mean equal representation  that is also equitable in its approach.  True   fairness   means   providing   all   stakeholders   with   a   commensurate   voice   in   the  decision-making processes that ultimately affect their lives and wellbeing.

The Innovation Playbook

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong outlined the three phases of organisational innovation, exploring the distinct strategies required for each stage.Organisational innovation can be understood through three key phases – 0-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-N+1 - each requiring a distinct playbook,0-to-1 involves the creation of entirely new products or services that do not yet exist in the marketplace. This phase of innovation requires the Silicon Valley Playbook, which emphasises first-principles thinking, swift iterations, and prototyping.In 1-to-N, the challenge shifts to scaling innovation and optimising operational efficiency. This phase requires the Standardisation Playbook which focuses on crafting repeatable processes to reach broader markets.During N-to-N+1, organisations must balance sustaining their core business while exploring new ventures. The approach here is to combine both The Silicon Valley and Standardisation Playbook, distributing sufficient resources while maintaining a clear yet synergistic separation between the core and new initiatives.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Innovation Playbook  Host:  Organisational innovation is often seen as a linear process, but in reality, it involves distinct  phases, each requiring a different strategy.  Understanding the nuances of these phases is crucial in cultivating successful innovation across  a broad range of organisational and industry contexts.  Now, to introduce us to the three phases of innovation and the distinct strategies required for  each stage, we're joined by Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed.  Dan is the former VP of Samsung's Media Solutions Centre, and previously served as Nokia's VP  of   Services   and   Software,   where   he   led   the   company's   feature-phone   to   smartphone  transformation in its largest global market.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University’s Antai School of Business,  where he teaches a course on AI and Product Innovation.  Dan Wong:  There are actually three different phases of innovation and actually three different playbooks.  The first phase is something that we call 0-to-1 innovation, and the best way to understand  what is 0-to1 is to first understand what it is not.  0-to-1 is not a development phase. It's not a development process in the sense that if take for  example, we're trying to develop a mobile phone app. Today, I have not started the  development, is that zero? And then after I've completed development, is that one? That is  actually not 0-to-1 innovation. That is the development process.  0-to-1 is very specific around creating a product or service that's completely new, that doesn't  exist in the marketplace today. One example would be this. A very historical example around the  automobile. The famous quote from Henry Ford says that if I were to ask my users today what  
they wanted, they would tell me, I want a faster horse. It's very hard for us to imagine  something that doesn't exist today, which is also why we cannot just survey the market.  Another example of 0-to-1 is, for example, Airbnb. It took a whole new concept to bring in  something called "crowd sharing". So there's a methodology around how do you create this  completely new product and service from nothing. And this is a set of methodologies that have  been pioneered, if you will, in Silicon Valley, where I actually spent a lot of my time living and  working. And I'll call this, for lack of a better term, the Silicon Valley Playbook, which  encompasses a couple things, right?  There's a philosophy around first principles. First principles meaning that you're thinking, you're  questioning all your assumptions when you're trying to think about a new transportation  methodology. You're not thinking about horses, you're thinking something completely different.  And coupled with that is a set of tools, such as the minimum viable product, which is creating a  very, very small size prototype, to get that to market very, very quickly, in an agile way, in  pivoting and learning.  And now we understand the reason why you have to create a prototype is because you cannot  ask the existing market what they want for something that doesn't exist. And the whole  mentality around 0-to-1 is a mentality around try fast, fail fast, take risk, be creative, find new  ways. And that is very much built into this 0-to-1 playbook.  The second phase is something I would call from One to N, and One to N is now taking this very  new product and scaling it across the mass market. And the skills you need to do that actually in  the approach is actually different. It's actually opposite of phase one. What you need to do is  you need to find a repeatable, scalable process. You need to remove all possibility for failure.  You need to implement in a repeatable way, meaning that you need standardised processes and  you want to keep your margin of error to the very, very minimum.  And this is an approach that is very commonly used in organisations today, in corporations, in  companies. It's a standard process. It's very often taught in business schools and very well  understood. And so this is the second phase– repeatable, scalable, standardised.  The third phase is something called N to N+1, and N to N+1 is on the foundation of an existing  business. And I'll call this existing business curve one to find a whole new business that is  additive to what you're doing. And that's what I'll call curve number two.  
So the third phase playbook is the combination of playbook one and playbook number two,  because you're trying to achieve two objectives at the same time. On the one hand, you need to  be conservative, repeatable, avoid errors for your core business. At the same time, you need to  do something opposite. You need to, in the service of developing this curve to new service, you  need to be risk-taking, you need to accept errors, you need to pivot, learn quickly.  And there are really two core elements here that need to be kept in mind for successful  implementation of this playbook number three. One is the balance of resources. How do you  make sure that you have the right organisational resources applied to these different curves of  your business?  The second core factor is how do you maintain sufficient separation, but yet communications  between these two businesses within the same organisation. What I mean by sufficient  separation is that they have enough autonomy to operate differently. These two playbooks are  playing by different sets of KPIs, different sets of expectations, different sets of measurement  and incentive metrics. That's the separation that I mean, but at the same time, we need to find  the synergies.  And so the second part of this is, how do we create a situation whereby these two very, very  different businesses and approaches are in communications? And so the magic occurs in this  third playbook, when that balance of resources, when that separation incentive is found in the  right way.  I'll give you one success case: Amazon. And Amazon started with pure e-commerce services, and  now most companies are a customer of Amazon's AWS, Amazon Web Services. And if you look  at what Amazon Web Services is, it's a completely different service offering. It requires  completely different skills. The nature of the business is completely different, and who you're  selling to is completely different.  And so Amazon is a case where they were able to find that combined playbook, they were able  to maintain their core business and continue to grow it, yet at the same time have resources  and a different approach available to build Amazon Web Services over time, which has now  become a very common industry standard.  Now that we understand that there are different playbooks in different phases. One piece  actually is the understanding that these three different playbooks are universally applied. It is  not the case that playbook number one is just for startups. It is not the case that playbook  
number two is just for companies. It is not the case that playbook number three is only for  conglomerates and corporations. This has much more to do with the phase of the company's  business model, product and service offerings, which all go through these three phases.  Which brings me to the second takeaway. If you are in the transformation phase, and I would  argue the most difficult phase of development, but the most critical one as well. Companies  that are able to do that will be able then to tap on top of their existing core business and their  big resources to then take it to the next level.And there's several, many, many companiesthat  have successfully traversed that curve.But the real core is employing two differentplaybooks at  the same time to achieve synergies.  Host:  Organisational innovation can be mapped through three key phases– 0-to-1, 1-to-N, and  N-to-N+1 -each demanding a distinct approach.  0-to-1 involves creating entirely new products or services that don’t yet exist in the  marketplace, drawing on the Silicon Valley Playbook. This phase emphasises first principles  thinking, rapid prototyping, and agile iterations.  As Dan mentioned, this phase is about questioning assumptions and taking calculated risks to  achieve breakthroughs.  1-to-N focuses on scaling innovation, turning a new product or service into a market-wide  success. This phase relies on the Standardisation Playbook, which prioritises creating  repeatable, scalable processes to ensure operational efficiency and minimise errors.  Finally, N-to-N+1 balances maintaining a core business while exploring new ventures. This phase  combines elements of both the Silicon Valley and Standardisation playbooks, ensuring  innovation and core operations coexist.  This demands thoughtful resource distribution while maintaining clear yet synergistic separation  between the core and new initiatives.

Transformation & Innovation’s New Scorecard

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong highlighted the essential strategies for navigating organisational transformation, focusing on overcoming the Innovator's Dilemma and the new scorecard for successful transformation.Beyond merely adopting new technologies, organisations must undergo systemic transformation to thrive in a rapidly changing world, rethinking operations at every level to remain relevant and competitive.The Innovator’s Dilemma illustrates how effective innovation requires companies to restructure internal processes and incentives, balancing core business stability with the pursuit of new opportunities.The new innovation scorecard goes beyond optimising shareholder value. Successful transformation now requires creating social value, which is essential for maintaining their licence to operate and achieving long-term success.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Transformation & Innovation’s New Scorecard  Host:  Faced with challenges from climate change to geopolitical complexity and the rise of AI, the  pressure to transform within the private sector has never been greater. But what does true  transformation entail and what can we learn from previous waves of transformation?  To help answer these questions, we're joined by Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed. Dan is the former  VP at Samsung's Media Solutions Centre and previously served as Nokia's VP of Services and  Software where he led the company's feature-phone to smartphone transformation in its  largest global market.  Dan is also an adjunct professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University's Antai School of Business  where he teaches a course on AI and product innovation. Dan will share with us his experience  of   leading   digital   transformation   efforts   in   global   companies,   including   the   universal  transformation lessons he has observed first-hand.  Dan Wong:  I will be talking about innovation in the context of organisational performance as well as  purpose. There's a survey that says that 45 percent of CEOs do not believe that their  organisation will be around in the same form for more than ten years. Which means that there's  a recognition that the environment around us is changing so quickly. There needs to be a basic  change in the way organisations need to operate.  And this is the purpose of transformation. And so facing this kind of environment, how do we  think about transformation? Is digital transformation simply applying some digital technology to  an existing process? And within this context, of course not.  So digital transformation is really about system level change. It's not just about one component,  including just using technology, it's shifting multiple systems at the same time. Which is why the  core of this and being successful is so difficult.  
But then another thing to be aware of is actually what is the purpose of transformation? Is it  cost reduction? Is it productivity? Is it finding new areas of growth and new revenue streams is  all of the above.  And as we all know, if we try to optimise for everything, we're optimising for nothing. And it  turns out that between these different objectives, it's actually looking for that new revenue  curve. What does that mean?  Well, the first curve actually means your existing revenue stream. This is the core business. And  on that basis, the objective now is to find something substantially different. So not an  incremental addition or extension of the existing revenue curve, but something very, very  different that takes the organisation to the new level.  Next, I'll share with you a case from the business school archives. And this is the case of Nokia.  And Nokia is a classical case around trying to find a completely new revenue stream to change  their business. And this isn't just a business school case.  I was in the middle of that actually driving the transformation in Nokia's largest market at the  time in China. Nokia very early on recognised the need for change. They recognised very clearly  that the market was shifting from feature phones to a new market called smartphones. And  they did believe that this was an entirely new market with different rules and different  capabilities.  On the surface, Nokia did everything right. They got the buy-in from everybody from the front  lines, various strategy sessions, you know, fireside chats to convince everybody of the need for  change and the reason that they needed to change the way they operate. Whole new  organisation was split out. My organisation, the multimedia business group, was designed to  find a new revenue curve in a way that's different from the feature phone market.  Nokia went forward to actually build its capabilities by acquiring companies, bringing on  external expertise. So from all these levels, Nokia did the right thing. But there's also a very  famous quote that says, "We did nothing wrong, and yet still we fail." For a period of time, the  mobile phone equaled Nokia. Yet Nokia's mobile phone business actually no longer exists. So  the real question is, why is that?  Nokia was an innovator. Nokia is the company that disrupted the inventor of the mobile phone,  Motorola. They were the risk taker. And it's the same leadership team that brought Nokia from  
a paper mill factory to telecommunications giant. But it was the same group of people, the  same leadership that also rode Nokia all the way down to nonexistence.  And this goes to then, now the core of the challenge for digital transformation. There's a theory  called The Innovator's Dilemma that was developed by Harvard business school professor  Clayton Christensen back in the 1990s, where he actually researched this phenomenon across  all industries and companies and found the same underlying reason why.  The thing that prevents you from finding that second curve of new revenue is a system level  problem. And let me explain what we mean by system level. When a company is looking at a  market, all the processes are designed to maximise four things. It's designed to make sure that  we're delivering high quality. Number two, we want to make sure high margins. Number three,  we want the largest possible existing market and the market share within that market. And  number four, we want to reduce risk, which comes to the problem. To the extent that  transformation is doing something new and different, very often it's the opposite of those four  factors.  When you do something new, the quality is likely low. It's likely at the very beginning stages.  Even for companies as big as Nokia, the margins will be low. There won't be lots of volume. In  terms of big markets, it's hard to predict how large that will be. After all, you're creating a new  market. And finally, you do need to take some risk.  So the whole requirement that you need to be successful in transformation actually is acting  against all the processes that are inbuilt into most organisations. And so once you do this, the  system then automatically tries to correct you. And this is the core of what is the Innovator's  Dilemma.  How do you solve the Innovator's Dilemma from the case of Nokia here? What we learn is this.  It’s not just the strategy and the mechanics. It's very much how do you set up the system to  enable you to have this kind of new disruptive innovation that brings new revenues? What do  we mean by system? I think the system contains four components within an organisation.  Number one, how do decisions get made?  Number two, where do you apply your resources between the old business and the new  business?  
Number three, how do you structure the organisation actually to do that, given that there are  different objectives and different methodologies.  And number four, the individual incentive systems for each person.  These are the core elements of the system that need to be changed and different from the core  system, you need to develop a new system.  In the case of Nokia, Nokia did part of that. There was the structure. But the real lesson here is  that it did not go far enough. And when you don't go far enough, it means that the existing  structure and the existing systems overtake anything you can do for the new. And to the extent  that Nokia could have gone further in terms of that balance, they would have been in a much  better position to compete with Apple.  And beyond that, they would be in a much better position to actually find a new additional  wave, a third wave, a fourth wave of a new business. And that business may not be even a  smartphone, it could be something different. And this is the thing that is very interesting in  terms of disruption, in terms of digital transformation. Very often, interestingly, it's actually only  clear in retrospect.  The revolution is only clear after the fact. The challenge is how do you, before the curve and the  shift happens, to put in enough of that investment; to give you the space to find that new  revenue curve to fight with the environment that is changing for you. So what does Nokia and  digital transformation teach us about transformation in general? What is the next phase of  transformation?  Transformation innovation doesn't stand still. It's constantly evolving. And in fact there is a new  scorecard, there's a new objective in terms of what transformation needs to lead to, and that is  really creating social value.  In the previous waves of transformation, it was enough to optimise for shareholder value. The  expectations that the broader environment has on organisations now is not just optimisation  just for stock price. It is how can an organisation provide additional value to the communities  and the societies that they're operating within?  This is now becoming more and more important for organisations in terms of maintaining  what's called their license to operate within their markets to the companies that are successful  
with this next wave. Not only will they protect their own business, they will actually be in a  much better position to create the longer term value that is both beneficial to themselves, but  also beneficial to the broader environment in which they operate.  Host:  The Nokia case study captures how even the most innovative companies can fail if they don't  recognise the system level demands of organisational transformation.  As Dan shared, Nokia's dramatic decline speaks to the core of the Innovator's Dilemma. This  dilemma highlights the challenge of balancing the stability of an existing business with the  pursuit of new opportunities.  In practice, this means that transformation isn't just about integrating new technology into  existing processes. It’s about rethinking entire systems and shifting multiple components of an  organisation simultaneously to discover new pathways for growth.And in today’s rapidly  evolving environment, digital transformation is no longer the only form of transformation we  need to consider.  According to Dan, there is a new scorecard for what transformation must seek to accomplish  beyond optimising for shareholder value. Successful transformation now requires creating social  value essential for maintaining an organisation's license to operate and achieving long-term  success.

Moving Beyond Business-As-Usual

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that businesses must be mindful of the risks that sticking to "business-as-usual" poses to their long-term viability and to ensure these are also accounted for to create greater organisational resilience. Breaking with "business-as-usual" requires becoming more attuned to the opportunities that lie in meeting societal needs and ensuring planetary wellbeing.Governments can further catalyse this by providing incentives for companies to enter into new areas that are often perceived as high-risk.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Moving Beyond “Business - As - Usual”  Elaine Fernandez:  What impetus do companies have to move beyond business - as - usual practices? Piyush Gupta,  Chief Executive Officer of DBS Group, takes us through how societal pressure, the risk of inaction  and potential business opportunities can all act as catalysts for bu siness to transform.  Piyush Gupta:  There are three motivations. One which is the most short term is it became a more and more  pressing need for our investors. Investors are asking what we're doing with this, our employees  are asking what we're doing with this. Our customers are asking. So t here's an external impetus  or an external catalyst. But the second and third are really more internal. The second catalyst is  the risk prism. As we start, we do activities and financing which goes out 10, 12, 15, 20 years  sometimes. And as we do that, it's   quite clear that what we are financing today, where we are  putting money out today, might not stand the test of time.  Today, if you finance a large coal - fired power plant and the world decides that these plants are  no longer going to be around in 5 to 10 years, what happens to my loan? How do I recover the  money? Therefore, we have to start taking a risk prism, which is w hat are the physical risks with  things like climate change, but also what are the transition risks, what policy changes can happen,  what new technology is going to come along?  You take the car industry. If I kept financing the internal combustion industry and put in   15 - year  loans, I can tell you the pace the way the world is going, they're all going to be replaced by EV  cars. So what am I going to do with my plant, which is doing IC when everybody's gone EV? So  there is a risk prism.  But the third prism is actually, to me, perhaps the most important to understand. I think this is  an incredible business opportunity. It's a business opportunity because the world we have  created today reflects 150 to 200 years of a particular kind of busi ness model, which is a high  carbon intensive business model. And we put trillions of dollars behind creating the various  business systems, our built environment or the building system, our manufacturing system, the
  energy system, the agricultural system, the marine system. Each of these has been architected  with trillions of dollars of extant investment sitting in there based on a model that we don't want  to follow in the future.  Now, how do you actually create a new low carbon intensive model over the next 10, 20, 30 or  whatever years that you have? You've got to basically jettison most of the trillions of   investments  that is lying here and reinvest. That reinvestment is a big, big opportunity. Somebody has to  finance this transition. Somebody has to finance the reinvestment. Somebody has to finance the  glide path from point A to point B. And therefore, if you are sens ible about understanding where  you are and where you and the sector needs to go, you can be ahead of the curve in finding the  solution, working with clients, and actually being profitably a part of the answer.  So the three different catalysts for causing us to think about this, where society is and what the  right thing to do is, what our risk prism tells us, and frankly, a profit agenda. We think there is a  business opportunity here as well. When we started look ing around, it's quite clear 80 to 90% of  our emissions come from these eight or nine big sectors. Energy is big, power is big –   automobiles,  airlines, shipping.  When we started talking to our clients, we realised many of our clients are beginning to think  about this, but still don't know how to go about it. And therefore, we said, if you can take a  leadership position in thinking about what are today's carbon inte nsities and a typical model, let's  say in the automobile industry, what is the typical carbon intensity of a combustion engine, where  does it come from? Which part of the supply chain causes it to happen? And then you said, okay,  suppose if you go down to   EV, what do you wind up in practice? Not zero. You still draw from the  electric grid, you need lithium, nickel, et cetera.   But we come to it, it's a better place to be.  And then we decided we would create the appropriate glide paths. But the glide paths are not  just us. We talk to the global agencies, International Energy Association, we talk to and figure out  what are suitable glide paths for this industry. And we use th ose glide paths to compare with our  own portfolio, our own client. We talked to over 3,000 of our clients to make sure that   we could  come up with a glide path which is credible, which was impactful, which would make a   dent and  shift the nature of the business model. But at the same time, it was   achievable,   and it was  something that our customers would benefit from working with us to achieve.  So that is the thinking behind what we plan. One, as you start dimensioning and making the risk  clearer, I think financial actors start acting of their own accord, because they're responsible for
  medium long - term risk. Today, people don't dimension and understand that as well. So we need  to do a better job of dimensioning the risk and making sure that people can understand those.  But the other character which is the profit agenda also, you need to help people understand that  this is a trillion dollar opportunity. So getting in early is actually in their best interest. We haven't  done a very good job of educating people on both side s of that pendulum. What is the risk  dimension, what is the returns dimension, so we can do a better job of that. I think, however, in  the short medium term, the role of the state and policy is crucial. And by that I mean not just  setting up, you can do th is, you can't do this regime, but creating the right incentives. And by that  I go back to this. If you can start pricing carbon whichever way you choose to do that, but you  put a price on carbon, and that will immediately put focus people's   minds and focus, because the  minute you price carbon, you can start pricing the risk and you can then also start creating the  incentives for the financial sector to allocate capital based on that underlying price of carbon,  which is now incorporated.  Second thing I alluded to before, for the financial sector, you can change the rules with respect  to things like capital and liquidity. Today we are supposed to keep capital to guard against risk.  That's the notion of capital. Expected risk goes through ou r P&L. Unexpected risk goes through  our capital. We keep capital for risk. If we all genuinely believe that a green investment is less  risky than a brown investment in the long term, then the regulators should charge less capital for  green investment. Conv ersely, they should increase the capital for brown investments. Today,  they approach everything with a single capital prism. I made the case to a lot of regulators. You  change that. So for all green investment, which is certifiably green, reduce the capita l regime by  2%. For brown investments to make it plus 2%, you watch immediately the financial sector will  start going to the green investment. I mean, it's simple.  You could do the same thing for liquidity rules. Today, liquidity rules. If I buy a bond of a green  company or a brown company, it's all the same. It's only driven by their credit rating. But what if  I added on top of that a layer, saying green industry bo nds qualify for higher liquid ratios than  brown industry bonds. Immediately you change the nature of the game. So the regulators and  policymakers, because they have the capacity to set the rules, but also set the incentive  mechanisms, I think they're the m ost likely path to actually getting the financial sector  convincingly on board.
  Elaine Fernandez:  Breaking with business as usual requires becoming more attuned to the opportunities that lie in  meeting societal needs and ensuring planetary wellbeing. Governments can further catalyse this  by providing incentives for companies to enter into new areas tha t are often perceived as high -  risk.  Piyush also reminds businesses to be mindful of the risk that sticking to business - as - usual poses  to their   long - term   viability. And to ensure these are also accounted for to create greater  organisational resilience.

The Core Functions of the State

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson highlighted how the government’s role in the 21st century goes beyond just creating the conditions for economic growth. Rather, good governance should primarily focus on creating stable, equitable societies.The State plays an essential role in managing resources, defending citizens' interests, implementing law and order, and improving quality of life, but they often fall short in areas such as corruption, nepotism, and human rights abuses.Despite the State’s indispensable role in creating a safe and secure society, we often take the State for granted. A balanced view is needed to consider the positive impact of a well-functioning government alongside addressing shortcomings.

The answers to this question are crucial for redesigning society because the government has a  hand in everything from safeguarding resources to providing infrastructure and generally keeping  nations safe, secure and well - functioning.  You’ll hear from, GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair, and GIFT Managing Director, Eric Stryson,  who will unpack the purpose of the government and make a case for why the State is  indispensable in providing citizens with dignified lives and addressing the exis tential threats of  our time.  Eric Stryson:  Ask yourself this. How well do you understand the workings of the state in your own country?  What is your understanding of the state and how it may differ from the government or the  political parties you often focus on in your country?  The state plays a crucial role in enabling a well - functioning society from national development  right through to ensuring food security and all of the basics that provide for a good quality of life  that you and I enjoy every day. The state is indispensable . Understanding the role of the state is  therefore essential for redesigning society.  This module will focus on the core functions of the modern state, its relevance to the  contemporary issues, which we are all faced with, and what makes a state effective and efficient.  It is also important to acknowledge, however, the limitations and the s hortcomings of states so  that we may better address the limitations and make improvements.  Effective governance is ultimately necessary to address the challenges at all levels, from providing  clean drinking water to tackling climate change. So let's talk about the core functions of the state.
  Imagine a world without governments. There would be no security, no rule of law, no way to  adjudicate disputes or harm. There would be no infrastructure like roads, like power, sewerage  systems. And of course, there'd be no currency or economic planning, n o economic development.  Well, historically, the key role of the state was to build and maintain order and to serve the  interests of its rulers. In modern times, the state plays an even more prominent role in society,  and its core objectives have evolved to include a wide variety   of functions. It defends the people's  interests. It helps to maintain and secure sovereignty for the country itself, of course.  Simple quality of life, things like the water that we drink, the food that we have access to, safe  and secure shelter, all of these things are provided by the modern state. There are things like  social opportunity, upward mobility, the ability to realise o ur personal and professional  ambitions. These too are provided by the modern state. Public health, ensuring clean water and  sanitation, and the access to healthcare services when we need them, when we fall sick. This too  is provided by the state.  Without a government, there would be an inability to make key decisions about managing society  and promoting socioeconomic development. Too often we take our governments for granted.  We are too quick to criticise and complain about the government's shortco mings without  recognising all of the benefits that we derive from a well - functioning and competent modern  government.  One example that we can look at is South Korea, a country which back in the 1960s was still very  poor and underdeveloped. Through the new village movement, the South Korean government  helped reduce rural poverty by two - thirds. Between 1970 and 1978, the go vernment promised  raw materials free of charge to the villages. It entrusted the villages to make their own decisions  about how to use the materials. It brought modern facilities like irrigation, road networks and  bridges, modern style homes to the village s and it allowed the villages to catch up with the urban  centres.  The new village movement in South Korea is now being studied around the world, including by  the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP. So this initiative by the government of  South Korea was a major intervention and development plan which helped lift   the country out of  poverty and put it on a path to becoming one of the most dynamic and developed economies in  the world.
  So, in conclusion, the state plays an indispensable role in managing resources, defending citizens  interests and securing the sovereignty of the country. The efforts to modernise countries and  improve the quality of life for all citizens is an essential ro le of the government.  Although we may have a tendency to take our governments for granted, we should all remember  that it does play an indispensable role in creating a safe and secure society through which we can  experience both the material and spiritual fulfilment and realise   our various personal and  professional ambitions.  Elaine Fernandez:  Governments play an indispensable role in creating a well - functioning society. They provide  access to basic services like sanitation, education, and housing, which many of us take for  granted. Through law and diplomacy, governments keep society safe and se cure.  Finally, the State creates the conditions for progress and prosperity, by investing in critical areas  across the economy and by helping the private sector thrive.

Strong States: A Necessity for Sustainable Development

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the necessity for States to be vested with sufficient capabilities and powers in order to further sustainable development.Sustainable development necessitates the active involvement of a robust, competent, and corruption-free governmental apparatus. States must possess the requisite capabilities to engage in intervention and regulation to influence the strategic direction of investments aimed at attaining sustainable outcomes. Take for example, how the centralised control China wields enabled it to execute vast targeted monetary policies earmarked specifically for sustainable development.The effectiveness of sustainable development hinges on the quality of governance, as without strong, transparent, and accountable States, any intervention or regulations aimed at driving sustainability are likely to fall short.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Strong States: A Necessity for Sustainable Development  Elaine Fernandez:  Governments are by no means perfect. But there's also no getting around the fact that  sustainable development at scale is only possible with leadership and support from the state.  Now you'll hear more from Professor Emeritus of Climate Strategy at the BI N orwegian  Business School, Jorgen Randers, who will further explain why sustainable development will  inevitably call for deliberate and capital state intervention.  Professor Jorgen Randers:  Totally obvious that we need to remove extreme poverty where it exists. And the only way to  get rid of extreme poverty in a sustainable manner is through good old - fashioned economic  development, where you increase the average labour productivity and you or ganise society  in such a manner that you get larger scale in the production of anything, so that the average  output per person per year goes up. And we know that this takes education, it takes health,  it takes the building of a non - corrupt society.  The only thing I no longer believe is necessary is a free market. Because I see that the Chinese,  over the last 40 years, did manage to remove poverty, extreme poverty, in a huge population  without using only the market, 80% market economy. But importantly , the government has  taken control of 20% of the economy, essentially the investment sector. And they make sure  that in China, one invests in what builds a strong China in the long run. So what the Chinese  have done is to maintain government control over i nvestments. They build the   infrastructure;  they build those institutions that are necessary in order to build a strong future. So they  decide they need 16 high speed railroads and 15 airports and 6,000 buildings of this and that  and the other type. And then they just instruct the people to do thos e things. And it only takes  20% of the manpower and capital and talent of China to do so. The other 80% they just leave  to the market.  And so the big difference is industrial policy. It is because the five - year plans are so good, they  are dimensioned to the capacity of the economy. They don't get inflation as you would get if  you started printing money and just giving it to the rich. I st arted by saying the totally obvious  number one goal, if you have the world as one unit, is to get rid of extreme poverty in the  poor world. And that can be done. It was done in Norway in the Western manner from 1945  to 1965. It was done in China in a diffe rent way from 1980 to now, a different way. So it can  be done.
  The only thing that does not work is the type of development that we have been pursuing  with Western support over the last 40 - 50 years, with normal development assistance, which  has not succeeded in removing extreme poverty, particularly in Africa, but als o in very many  other places.  So that is what needs to be done with global poverty. Concerning rich world poverty in the  North, it's simply a question of redistribution. So there you solve the poverty problem simply  by taking money from the rich and give it to the poor. You do this eit her as cash transfers or  more recently as publicly paid health, publicly paid education, publicly paid unemployment  benefits, pension systems and the whole schmear.  Elaine Fernandez:  As Professor Randers has shared, by taking a hands - on approach to guiding the investment  industry ecosystem, China was able to build the infrastructure, systems and institutions  needed to lift the majority of its population out of poverty. In light of its   size, history and form  of governance, China is obviously a unique case, which is why Professor Randers suggests that  state intervention should vary according to a country's development level and context.  In lower income countries, it is a question of improving essential infrastructure to enable  access to basic needs and growing human capital to increase labour productivity, whereas in  higher income countries, Professor Randers believes in the power of redi stributing existing  resources through fair and effective taxation to benefit more vulnerable members of society.  Both of these approaches require strong state intervention focused on delivering outcomes  efficiently and free from vested interests.

ASEAN – A Case Study for the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani highlighted how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can serve as a template for peaceful coexistence in a multipolar world.The increasing diversity of influential nations necessitates the cultivation of a robust culture of peaceful coexistence, built on mutual respect for diverse values and interests. This is crucial for maintaining stability in a multipolar world.The success of ASEAN in fostering peace and prosperity amidst diversity serves as a model to be emulated by the rest of the world, as it offers valuable lessons for fostering stability in a multipolar world.The European Union, in particular, should learn from ASEAN's ability to collaborate with diverse societies and seek closer ties with its Islamic neighbours, while also investing in developing Africa.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  ASEAN: A Case Study for the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  A multipolar post-Western world order means a more diverse range of powers will influence the  direction of global affairs.  Many of the nations stepping up to the plate - China, India, Turkey, to name a few - represent  varied cultures, socioeconomics, and even governance systems.  This in turn necessitates cultivating a robust culture of peaceful coexistence, built on mutual  respect for diverse values and interests.  But, given the turbulence we've seen even in the unipolar era, can a multipolar world actually  offer greater stability?  According to Professor Kishore Mahbubani, former President of the United Nations Security  Council and Distinguished Fellow at the Asian Research Institute, there is cause to hope.  He takes us through a real-world example of coexistence that we can learn from - the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, also known as ASEAN.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  As you know, the success of ASEAN is a real miracle. And that's why I wrote a book called The  ASEAN Miracle, and I called it the ASEAN miracle because ASEAN is by far the most diverse  corner of planet Earth.  You know, around 670 - 680 million people in ASEAN. You have 250 million Muslims, 150 million  Christians, 150 million Buddhists, Mahayana Buddhists, Hinayana Buddhists, and you have  Taoists, Confucianists, Hindus. And as you know, we have lots of communists too in our region.  So it's a really remarkably diverse region of planet Earth. And everyone describes Southeast Asia  as the Balkans of Asia. Everyone expected the Balkans of Asia to be on fire, to be having  
conflicts and fighting each other. And instead, Southeast Asia has ended up as one of the most  peaceful and prosperous corners of planet Earth.  And this is where, frankly, the rest of the world should try to understand why ASEAN succeeded.  What are the lessons of ASEAN for the rest of the world? And perhaps the ASEAN success can  provide a model for a world, as you know, that is becoming increasingly divided and polarised.  All great powers should come to ASEAN to learn the lessons from us.  Well, I think we are certainly experiencing great power shifts. And as we know, in the Cold War,  the United States was far more influential in Southeast Asia than any other great power. The  shocking thing that many Americans do not know is that ASEAN was a pro-American creation. In  fact, it was set up in the Cold War to lean on the side of the United States against the Soviet  Union. And if you want proof, look at what the Soviet Union and China said on 8 August 1967,  on the day when ASEAN was created. They condemned the creation of ASEAN. So there's so  many reservoirs of goodwill towards the United States of America in Southeast Asia.  Which   is   why   the   United   States   should   pay   greater   attention   to   Southeast   Asia.   But  unfortunately, after winning the Cold War, the United States lost interest in Southeast Asia and  moved away. And as a result of that, China has stepped up its links with Southeast Asia.  So to give you one figure that points out how much closer ASEAN has become to China. In the  year 2000, US trade with ASEAN was $135 billion, more than three times China's trade of $40  billion. By 2020, US trade with ASEAN had grown from 135 billion to over 300 billion. So an  increase   of   two   and   a   half   times.   But   China's   trade   with   ASEAN,   especially   after   the  China-ASEAN free trade agreement was signed, increased from 40 billion to 800 billion, an  increase of 20 times. So US trade with ASEAN used to be more than three times China's trade  with ASEAN. Now China's trade with ASEAN is more than double American trade with ASEAN.  That's an example of how things have shifted. But I want to emphasise that the ASEAN countries  want to have good ties with China and they want to have good ties with the United States. And  they would actually welcome the United States signing a free trade agreement with the ASEAN  countries.  But as you know, in the US today, free trade agreements have become so politically toxic, it's  impossible for the United States to even propose a free trade agreement with the ASEAN  countries. And that's tragic, because if the United States did so, I think the ASEAN countries  would be very happy and they would welcome it very strongly. The one big lesson that the  
European Union should pick up from ASEAN is that it is possible to collaborate closely with  societies that come from other cultures, other religions, other civilisations.  As you know, Turkey has applied for membership of the European Union much earlier than  many of the Eastern European states have. And in many ways, I would say Turkey could have  qualified for membership of the European Union. But there was one fundamental reason why  Turkey was never admitted into the European Union is because Turkey is Muslim and the  European Union states are all Christian. And, you know, these Christian states cannot accept the  idea that they can collaborate with a non-Christian state like Turkey. Now, frankly, that's very  unwise of the European Union.  So the European Union should find ways and means of getting closer to its Islamic neighbours.  Not just Turkey, but the countries in North Africa - Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, even Egypt and  Libya are very, very close to Europe. But they have never been embraced by Europe in any kind  of regional organisation where they are accepted as equals or treated as equals. And this is  where it's a mistake for the European Union because, you know, the long term threat to the  European Union is not going to come from Russian tanks. Even though there's a war in Ukraine,  Russian tanks are not poised to enter Europe in any significant way. They don't pose any kind of  immediate threat to Europe.  But in the long run, the biggest threat to Europe is going to come from the demographic  explosion in Africa, both in Sub-Saharan Africa and in North Africa. And so it'd be wiser for the  European Union to find ways and means of developing Africa, working with Africa. And if the  European Union wants to learn how to work with cultures and civilisations that are so different,  the European Union should come and learn lessons from the ASEAN countries.  Rohan Hazell:  Although ten countries make up the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations, ASEAN, it remains  one   of   the   most   peaceful   places   on   Earth,   despite   expectations   of   conflict   due   to its  unparalleled diversity.  It has also successfully balanced geopolitical and economic relations with the West and rising  powers like China and India, meaning the region is becoming increasingly prosperous.  Professor Kishore has called this the “ASEAN Miracle” and suggests that ASEAN’s success can  provide a model for cooperation in a world that is becoming increasingly polarised.

Shareholder vs Stakeholder Primacy: An Issue of Timeframes

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that by taking greater long-term gains into consideration, organisations can create better alignment between shareholder and stakeholder interests. To be viable in the long-term - beyond shareholders and the wider stakeholder ecosystem - businesses also have an obligation to the societies that grant them the licence to operate. This means companies must ensure that their business models contribute to societal and planetary wellbeing, not just the bottom line.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Shareholder vs Stakeholder Primacy:  An Issue of Timeframes  Elaine Fernandez:  In a world where business must balance the needs of a range of shareholders and stakeholders,  the question is, who takes precedence? Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer of DBS Group, the  largest bank in Southeast Asia by total assets, shares his views on this debate and addresses  why he considers the supposed conflict between shareholder and stakeholder interests to be an  issue of time frames.  Piyush Gupta:  So I'm going to give you a slightly nuanced view, but it's important. The first is based on this  premise that companies get created and given legal form and become legal entities. Most  people think of that as giving them some rights and typically it gives them some protection. So  you have limited liability. Your directors, your management, the liability is not yours. As an  individual, the liability belongs to the corporation. My view on this is that once you are given  legal form, then you don't just get rights, you also get responsibilities. Otherwise it would be a  one-sided thing.  I want the rights and I want the protection as a legal form, but then I don't want the  responsibilities as a legal form. So to me you've got to buy into that argument that by getting a  legal form and having an identity, then you inherit some responsibilities in that legal form. This  is important because most people tend to think of this as only a platform for doing business.  I think you actually get a legal form, which means that there are some obligations.  Put another way, I think most companies when we get created, we tend to think of ourselves as  being licensed by a regulator. You go to a company's authority to be incorporated. I think at the  same time you also have to get a different licence. And that licence is a licence from civil society,  a licence that says that you are relevant. We are giving you this form because we think that you  are going to be relevant to doing things which are important to us.  
That question of how you are relevant to society, to your country, to your community, to the  planet. I think therefore this is a really important question that should be reflected in the  responsibilities that we hold. So what is our element? I'm fortunate when I joined DBS. DBS was  born from this kind of ethos. It was created in the late 60s as the Development Bank of  Singapore with one express intention to help in the development of the country. And if you talk  to some of the old timers, they will tell you that for the first ten years of existence, DBS had zero  profit agenda. In fact, they sometimes laughingly tell me that DBS’ stock price did not move in  the first decade because they weren't worried about profits, they were only worried about:  Does it make sense for the development of Singapore and the people of Singapore?  Now, when I say nuance, I mean I think the argument and the DBS positioning in the first ten  years is not tenable or sustainable either. I think for companies to have a long life, you need to  be willing to create a decent return for people who put in capital, and they are part of your  stakeholder group. So to ignore it entirely, I don't think it works either. But to make that the  singular purpose of what you're doing return something to the shareholder, I think that ignores  the other responsibilities and obligations you have as a legal entity. One of the other reasons  why I think companies have to think about this is, in truth, companies have a lot more agency  sometimes than governments do.  A lot of people would argue that companies should do what they need to do. We've created a  government and there are enough other agents in the government who can take care of the  kinds of challenges you talked about, whether it's biodiversity or climate or social welfare. I  would argue that in many ways the governments are a lot more constrained than private sector  corporations are.  We operate in multi-jurisdictions, we operate across borders and boundaries, and no country or  no state government has the multi-jurisdictional opportunity. We are closer to the ground, so  we understand what is going on. And our actions can create impact and influence in some ways  much quicker than government actions can. So I think not only do we have an obligation, we  have an ability to act, an agency to act, which puts us in a very distinctive position, sometimes  much better than the government's ability to act and respond.  Therefore, I think this idea of multi-stakeholder thinking is crucial to us. We have to think about  our   shareholders,   but   equally   we   have   to   think about the society, our employees, our  customers, governments, the whole shebang. And if we do that sensibly and well, we can make  a meaningful impact without necessarily compromising on the returns objective that our  shareholders have.  
So let me reflect on both things.  The first is why I say this is really no inherent conflict, it's a time frame problem. It’s simply this.  That if I were a shareholder and I’m looking for the extra 2% return for the next quarter or the  next year, there would be a conflict because the company was using its resources to do the right  thing for society or do the right thing for the planet, it might have to take on incremental costs  in the short term.  So you could argue there's a compromise for short-term profits because you're having to spend  the money needlessly. But I would argue that most shareholders, certainly I know my investing  temperament, but most long term shareholders would say, I’d much rather get a 13% return  consistently over the next ten years, than get a 15% return this year and then not be around in  five years.  Now the question is this, if you are willing to invest that extra 1 or 2% in doing the right things  for society, does that give you greater longevity? And where I come out on this is it does. That  frankly, when I say you've got to be relevant to society, you've got to get a licence from civil  society. The licence of civil society is a renewable licence. Every year, two years, wherever  society comes back and says, are you still relevant? Are you doing the right thing? And if you  are, then we will support you. Now, what happens if you go through several years of not doing  the right thing? You made short-term profits, but sooner or later society will yank their licence  away from you. So you made a lot of money in the short term, but you compromised longevity  in doing that.  To me, the real question is if you think about shareholder return as shareholder returns over a  long period of time, then the smart shareholder will say, I'm happy to compromise a percent or  two if it needs to be, because I will make these returns over 10, 20, 30, 40 years. And the  minute you therefore change the time frame and say what maximises shareholder return over  30 years, you get a very different answer than when you say what maximises the shareholder  return over the next twelve months. And that's why I say it's a time frame question.  Now the next thing therefore, short-termism, I think this is a real problem. If you go back to  management literature, the agency theory case used to be that management thinks short term  and shareholders think long term. And therefore you need to corral or put guardians around the  management to make sure their thinking is aligned to shareholders' thinking. Guess what? Fast  forward to today's world. A large number of our shareholders hold the stock for three months,  
six months, if you're lucky, a year. Managements at least hang around for three, five, seven  years,   in   my   case   over a decade. So I would argue that the table has actually turned  management sometimes on a much longer term perspective than shareholders do. But that's  tongue-in-cheek. But the real point is this, that as long as you have people looking for  short-term returns because shareholders are short-term driven, you do run into this conflict of  time frame problem.  To me, therefore, the answer is this. How do you try to put some processes in place that creates  greater long-term capital in corporations? Once you do that, you get much better alignment of  the agenda between shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capital.  Elaine Fernandez:  By taking greater long term capital into consideration, organisations can create better alignment  between   shareholder   and   stakeholder interests. But beyond shareholders and the wider  stakeholder ecosystem to be viable in the long term, businesses also have an obligation to the  societies that grant them the licence to operate. This means ensuring that business models  contribute to societal and planetary wellbeing, not just the bottom line.

Redesigning Society: The Intersection of Business and the Government

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the indispensable symbiotic relationship between government and business in redesigning society.Companies are becoming increasingly aware that they must work closely with government and civil society to build more equitable and resilient societies. Cross-sector collaboration is critical to facilitate the transitions that are inevitable in societal transformation. The private sector, with its vast expertise, can take the lead by engaging constructively with governments to ensure that business solutions and regulations are both sensible and just.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Society:  The Intersection of Business and Government  Elaine Fernandez:  Transforming the private sector is critical to redesigning society for a sustainable future. But  equally important is regulating that transformation to ensure it occurs in a manner that is  equitable   to   all   the   stakeholders   involved.   And   this   will   ultimately   require   government  intervention.  To shed more light on the intersection between the public and private sectors, we have Richard  Lancaster, Executive Director and former Chief Executive Officer of CLP holdings, one of the  largest private power producers in the Asia-Pacific region.  Richard Lancaster:  Whether   it's   climate   targets   or   sustainability targets, generally, there is a role that the  government can play in helping businesses achieve those targets. And that role can vary. In the  case of decarbonisation, I can give you some practical examples. We operate coal-fired power  stations that in some countries, or in some states, provide you know maybe 10 or 15 percent or  even more of the state's power. So they're a very important asset. The government doesn't  want us to just close these down without having a replacement. So it's important that we  recognise that and we talk to them about a sensible transition plan.  But these are plants that in some cases have been operating for more than 100 years. They have  coal mines, they have whole support industries and contractors and suppliers that rely on that  power station. So entire communities are impacted when that plant closes down. Now, we as a  business can help with that transition, we can help with re-education, but we can't necessarily  just re-employ that industry elsewhere. That's where the government needs to step in and help.  So   when   you're   talking   about   just   closing   one   fossil   fuel   plant,   the   complexity of the  conversation that you need to have with the government about planning for its replacement,  about ensuring the right timescales, about how to deal with the impacts on the community,  those are very big discussions. And that's just one coal plant.  
Everywhere you operate, you have to have those conversations. But if you can do it, it reduces  the risk to the business, it increases the certainty, it gives you something to plan towards. And  that is a big benefit to business. Look, I'll give you a second example as well around energy  efficiency. And energy efficiency is so important to the energy transition, because if we waste  energy, it just makes it more costly and takes longer for us to decarbonise.  Energy efficiency is really important. If you can get a standard that is regulated, then everyone  can work to that standard. And when you retrofit a building, or if you're building a new building,  it's not just fitting fancy, more efficient gadgets, it's about the whole fabric of the building, it's  about building in new technologies. And if you haven't got a skilled workforce that can not only  install them and understand them, if you haven't got architects that can specify them, and if you  haven't got people that can maintain them, then it's not going to work.  So that's where regulations can actually help set the standard, can help coalesce all the  supporting infrastructure that you need to make a building not only efficient, but also make it  work in the long run and be maintainable and have everything all aligned. So government  regulations shouldn't be seen as interference and a problem, they should be seen as something  that can help.  I don't think industry or business and government are used to working collaboratively together.  There is always a perception in the mind of a regulator or in the mind of a government  policymaker that businesses are just there to make a buck and that's all that they're interested  in. I think businesses can do a lot more to build trust and businesses can be starting to take  more of a leadership role and starting to initiate these conversations.  I believe that business has a lot to bring to the table, it has a lot of expertise. It does know what  needs to be done I think having these conversations in a constructive way with your regulators  and with government can lead to more sensible solutions, more sensible regulation, and  conversations around what we as the business sector can do and what government can do, and  how we can work together to make our business successful, but also to make our society  successful as well. And if we strike that balance and have those conversations looking more  holistically than just "I'm here for profits and that's it," then I think we will make progress.  And I think the world is changing. I think the issues that we're seeing, whether it's climate  change,   whether   it's   waste management, whether it's the circular economy, I think the  sustainability conversations that we're starting to see, I'm seeing more and more businesses  
starting to realise that they can play a role, they can play a leadership role, and a natural flow on  from that is to sit down with governments and start talking about how we can contribute to  making a better society.  Elaine Fernandez:  Cross-sector collaboration is critical to facilitate the transitions that are inevitable in societal  transformation. The private sector, with its vast expertise, can take the lead by engaging  constructively with governments to ensure that business solutions and regulations are both  sensible and just, taking into consideration their impact on the communities and environment  in which business operates.

Escaping Poverty: Empowering the Marginalised & Tackling Market Failures

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, KAM Morshed explored how civil society can alleviate poverty by equipping the marginalised with the necessary resources and access to opportunity.Civil society plays a crucial role in empowering and equipping marginalised populations with the skills, resources and services necessary to break the cycle of poverty.Beyond empowerment, civil society can also address market failures by establishing social enterprises and initiatives tailored to serve populations often overlooked by conventional businesses and government support systems.To achieve lasting poverty alleviation, civil society must prioritise a holistic approach that connects people to markets, necessitating a dual focus on both production and market dynamics.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Escaping Poverty:  Empowering the Marginalised & Tackling Market Failures  Host:  Civil society organisations, or CSOs, can play a vital role in equipping poorer communities with  the tools to escape poverty.  One   leading CSO   in this area is BRAC: an international development organisation founded in  Bangladesh in 1972 that works with marginalised communities across Asia and Africa.  It has an annual operating budget in the hundreds of millions of   dollars and   earns much of this  through their own network   of social   enterprises.  BRAC has been recognised as the top development organisation in the world for multiple  consecutive years by the Geneva - based media organisation, NGO Advisor.  Now, using examples from BRAC's decades - long experience, we'll hear from its Senior   Director,  Mr.   KAM Morshed, about how equipping marginalised communities with the necessary tools and  tackling areas in which markets have failed, can contribute to ending poverty.  KAM Morshed:  So our core mission is to really rekindle hope for those who have lost it because they were  marginalised for many generations. So to do that, what we do is we give them small grants or  loans. We improve access to vital services like education and healthcar e, and offer job training,  for example. We empower marginalised groups to influence decision - making process so that they  can be part of important decisions, public decisions that affect their life.  This comprehensive approach that we take aims to enhance the quality of the life of those who  are in difficulty now. And   of course,   their next generation. So it's not only them, it's also their  next generation, their children. So we have education for children, we have education and other
  services for adolescents, for even mothers. And so to really help people get out of their current  adversities, if you may.  So additionally, we also have social businesses, including lifestyle stores, dairy products, farming  inputs, investment in some purely commercial enterprises like SME bank, insurance company. So  these initiatives tackle the market failure and serve a popul ation often overlooked by the  conventional markets. So   initially   our programme   focused   on   empowering   marginalised  communities that often found themselves in the fringes of society. But then we realised that  there is another obstacle for them to make use of   the market, which economists call it market  failure.  You know, big companies, corporations don't find it sometimes economical, attractive enough to  go and serve the people in the bottom of the pyramid, or also work with them. In response, we  started our own lifestyle brand, which is now the premium lifestyle   brand of Bangladesh in 1978.  So the idea was that not only we are providing the skills, the tools, the finance to the local  artisans, so that they can produce more, so that their products are also sold to the right market,  so that they are not cheated or deprived by the middlemen. We   started BRAC chicken, which is  not only selling the day - old chicks to the farmers, but also buying the eggs so that, you know, we  are providing an end - to - end value chain solution. But then over time, as we adapted to evolving  needs and challenges, both our   livelihood interventions became   sophisticated,   and our market  access or market support system got extended. For example, now we are working with people  who are poor or were disempowered due to climate change impacts or due to urban challenges  and so on. But on the other hand, if you look at our market   support system, that has also become  sophisticated.  For example, we are one of the sponsors of the world's largest mobile financial system called  bKash, which enables the people to do the transaction especially people living in the margin do  the transaction at a lower cost and more securely. Our latest init iative is to introduce large - scale  crop insurance for the first time in Bangladesh. We are trying to connect with the people, with  the market so that whatever development that happens is sustainable.  But to do that you really need to work with both the market side and also on the people side. So  production and market both are being tackled together. So that's our approach to a sustainable  escaping of poverty, if you may.
  Host:  As Mr. Morshed alluded to, breaking the cycle of poverty requires a multifaceted approach.  People living in poverty around the world must be empowered with the necessary tools, in the  form of skills, access to employment, or financial support, to pull themselves out of the  intergenerational cycle of poverty.  BRAC's case proves that it isn't enough to just   empower impoverished   individuals, you also need  to address the systemic shortfalls, or 'market failures' as Mr. Morshed puts it, that perpetuate  their entrapment in poverty.  In these instances, CSOs can step up and fill the gaps, as BRAC has shown with its own lifestyle,  poultry, and dairy enterprises that provide gainful employment and goods for impoverished  communities.

Turning the Story Around: Designing Regenerative and Distributive Economies

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Kate Raworth emphasised the need to move towards regenerative and distributive economic systems that align with the Doughnut model, balancing ecological sustainability with social equity.The current linear, degenerative industrial system must evolve into a circular economy, reusing and recycling resources to reduce ecological impact and work within Earth's natural cycles.Regenerative practices can be implemented at multiple scales, from landscape restoration to industrial recycling and urban redevelopment, as seen in Seoul’s transformation of a highway into a river and park.Current economic systems concentrate wealth and opportunity in the hands of a few, necessitating a shift towards a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.Kate Raworth critiqued the traditional profit-maximising business model in favour of worker-owned and cooperative models, exemplifying how businesses can contribute to a more equitable distribution of value.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Turning the Story Around:  Designing Regenerative and Distributive   Economies  Rohan Hazell:  20th - century economic models have propelled humanity to where we are   today but   are still  characterised by human deprivation and ecological overshoot.  Oxford economist Kate Raworth suggests a new sustainable and equitable paradigm with  economies that are regenerative and distributive by design.  Kate Raworth:  So, the Doughnut shows us that there is massive human deprivation and already massive  ecological overshoot. How do we turn this story around? It's clear that the guidance, the values  from 20th century economics will not get us there. Growth does not even   things up again, and it  definitely does not clean up after itself.  So, we cannot take these as a guide. We need new economic thinking. We need to create  economies that are distributive by design and that are regenerative by design. Only with that  intention will we   start to reverse the direction we've been going in. Let me tell you what I mean.  We've inherited economies that take earth's materials, make them into stuff we want. We use it  for a while, often only once, and then we throw it away. And this take, make, use, lose is a  degenerative industrial system that is running down the life support   systems of our planetary  home. We have to turn these linear, degenerative arrows into circular or cyclical arrows that go  round and round, so that we don't use things up. We use them again and again, far more  carefully,   more collectively, more creatively   and more slowly.  And that is key to reducing our impact on the earth, to reducing our use of energy and materials,  so that we start to work with and within the cycles of the living planet. Some examples of what  that can look like at the scale of landscapes. We're going fro m degenerating landscapes to  landscape restoration, and even just seeing these images. I believe that as human beings who
  are a living part of this planet, we breathe differently. We breathe in when we see that image of  restoration. Earth is generous to us, she has been   generous,   and she comes back, she regenerates  herself when we give her a chance.  At the scale of industry and technical materials, we need to move away from throwing our waste  into the neighbourhoods of the world's poorest people, to repairing and refurbishing and sharing  and reusing in a circular or cyclical economy. And this must bec ome the design embedded in  every product that we use.  At the level of a city, this city centre in Seoul in South Korea had a   ten - lane   car highway, and it's  been converted into a river and a park. That is not Photoshop, that is real. Imagine and feel the  life in that city and how it's changed. And let's come right down to the level of hospital. Where  would you rather be getting better? I n this nature - less hospital in the UK or this nature - rich  hospital in Singapore? We know that human beings heal better and faster when we can see other  parts of nature.  So from the global, to the industrial, to the city, to the building scale ,   t here are so many ways we  can create economies that are regenerative by design .   Secondly though, another dynamic , w e've  inherited economies that are divisive by design. They capture opportunity and value in the hands  of a few. This is giving rise to a global 1%, often a national 1%. We see that happening. We have  no chance of getting into the Doughnut with such extreme s of inequality in the world. We have  to create economies that are   distributive by design, that share value and opportunity far more  equitably with all who co - create it.  And I ask anybody, what could possibly be objectionable about that sharing value and  opportunity that's created with all who co - create it? What can that look like? Let me give you a  couple of examples.  Housing. In London, there is a crisis of affordable housing, because decades ago, Margaret  Thatcher sold off our social housing and to turn it to private housing, it then got turned into an  investment asset. So in London, as in many major cities, housing i s treated as an investment asset,  where landlords can then reap a high return through rent on their asset. And many, many people  are left without the prospect of ever owning their own home and unaffordable rents.  In the city of Vienna, by stark contrast, over 60% of people live in social housing that   is   owned by  the city or by city run cooperatives. It's central, it's affordable, it's normal, it   is   good quality,  because the city of Vienna decided 100 years ago that housing is not an investment option, it's a
  human right. And they decided for the housing of the city to be owned in a way that enabled it  to be treated as a human right. What about in the world of business? We know the norm of  business has been led by profits.  Business is designed to maximise profit. This extracts as much value as possible from the workers.  It extracts as much value as possible from the living world, creating waste and pollution and  withdrawing financial profits for the shareholders or owners of   the company. That's just one  design of business, which turns out to be an extremely divisive design. Business can be designed  in many other ways to share value back with all who co create it.  This craft production company in Mumbai, which is owned by the workers, so the value is shared  back with them as workers who contributed. There are many, many different ways we can design  not only the housing, not only our businesses, but how we travel, ho w we own technology, how  ideas are owned. Are they corporately privatised? or are they placed in the commons? so we can  create economies that are far more regenerative and distributive by design.  Rohan Hazell:  Regenerative economies move beyond the linear 'take - make - use - lose' model to a more circular  approach.  Distributive economies address the divisive nature of current economic systems, which  concentrate wealth and   opportunities in the hands of a few.  For both governments and businesses, keeping these two goals at the forefront of economic  activity and policymaking will help us become more focused and deliberate in our efforts at  redesigning society.

The Social Obligation of Business

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that beyond legal and financial obligations to its government and shareholders, business also bears a social obligation to society.Business has a moral obligation to ensure the societies in which it operates thrive. It also has a financial obligation to investors and other stakeholders to ensure its long-term viability.This requires rebalancing business priorities and partnering with government, civil society, and other companies to mitigate risks and generate sustainable solutions.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Social Obligation of Business  Elaine Fernandez:  Every component of society, from the individual to the enterprise, has obligations to fulfil for a  range of stakeholders. The question is, outside of legal and financial responsibilities, what social  obligation does business have to society?  To shed some light on this, we have Vivek Pathak, Global Head and Director of Climate Business  at the International Finance Corporation or the IFC, who shares his insights into whether  businesses must contribute to building greater societal resilience.  Vivek Pathak:  So yes, there is a moral obligation, and the way I put it is you have a moral obligation to your  investors actually. You're running a company today and you've got long-term investors in there.  You have a moral obligation to ensure that your company will survive the next 10 or 15 years,  whether it's on climate risks or whether it's in the whole decarbonisation transition. So that's  the way I like to position it, really.  Do we have a moral obligation to the population at large? Absolutely, I think so. I really want to  position it more as you have a moral obligation or a financial obligation to your investors. A lot  of debate, as you would have seen in the press now, on the short-term versus medium-term.  And obviously this is not a short-term game, this is a medium-term game.  I remember I did this exercise a few years ago, and I looked at the top ten companies a few  years ago, which were listed on the Dow or the Nasdaq, more the Dow I think. And it's really  interesting that out of those ten companies, I think eight or nine of them were not there 30,  25 or 30 years ago, or even 20 years ago. So what I tell people is, folks, look what technology  has done. So this is purely, I would sit in a financial play. Do you want to be in a sector or a  company that may not exist the way it exists today? My own reading and my hope is that 20  years from now, you will have a completely different set of industries which are focused on  decarbonisation, on nature-based solutions potentially. I mean, they're going to be sectors  which I don't even know will open up, to be honest. Green hydrogen. Three years ago, nobody  
was talking about it. Today, it's the rage. So we have to look at it from that perspective, that  business is evolving very rapidly and it's going to continue. And do you want to be in a space  which is going to be existing 15 to 20 years from now, or in a space which may disappear or be  marginalised 15 to 20 years from now?  So what we are seeing is it's actually a confluence of three factors, really. One is in some cases,  it's driven by governments where governments are mandating certain things. Second is I think  we are seeing a lot more consciousness in the stakeholders or the population at large. People  are demanding to know what is happening, what is the carbon intensity of my product. And I'm  really waiting for the day when all our products will have a little, you've got a little barcode  here. I would love to see a day when this barcode also tells you the carbon footprint of this. So  that's when people can make active choices. Do I want something with a low carbon footprint  or do I want something with a high carbon footprint?  And then there are businesses that have said, "Listen, yes, short-term I'm going to invest, but  I'm going to get my returns in the medium-term." So fundamentally, let's try and break it down.  Energy. If I can become more energy efficient, I consume less energy. I consume less energy, I  reduce my energy bills. As simple as that. So that's really the way to look at it. It's as much of an  art as a science, I would argue, because sometimes you have to estimate impact, things like  that. But we definitely think that the discourse has changed. I mean, last year I was at COP 26 in  Glasgow, the first COP I attended. But what I was told is that at COP 21, which was in Paris, it  was all about advocacy. Is climate change for real? Is it happening? And it's about the public  sector. COP 26 was completely dominated by the private sector coming out and making pledges,  an outfit called GFANZ, which was created by Mark Carney, Global Financial Alliance for Net  Zero, totalling north of $130 trillion. They've committed to reaching net zero.  So I think there has been a lot of movement but as I keep saying, this is a transition. We need to  understand it's not an on-off switch. So it's easy to put up a solar farm relatively, don't get me  wrong, but how do you decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors? Steel, cement, chemicals, fertilisers.  We cannot ignore these sectors. So how do you get that transition? I think that's really the  critical question in the years ahead.  Now, the role of the public sector is absolutely critical. When I say the private sector is going to  make it happen, it's private capital, private technologies. But you do need the public sector or  governments for a number of reasons. They need to create an enabling environment. They need  to create the right policies to attract that investment to make things happen. They need to  
provide incentives in some cases and in some cases, like I said, building a sea wall to protect a  coastal community is not for the private sector to do because there are no cash flows to give  you returns. So that's really where government capital or public sector capital should go in, in  sectors where you cannot make it viable for the private sector to come in. And there is a space  in between which is not viable today, but will be viable hopefully a few years from now. And  that's where you really need "PPPs" and you need the government and philanthropic capital to  come in.  And the best example is about 15 years ago, I think, when IFC invested for the first time in solar  tariffs which were between 28 to 32 cents. Today, the last auction in India went at 2 cents.  In Chile, it went at 1.2 cents. So this goes to prove that with the right incentives, with  technological advances and scaling up, you will drive the cost down in a lot of these sectors and  make it a lot more affordable. So much of the cost of solar and wind have come down very, very  dramatically. I think we need to understand that you still need a solution, because solar is in the  day, you don't know when it's going to come. So you either need battery storage, which makes  it very expensive. So you do need transition fuels. And I would argue that gas is a transition fuel  today.  But you need to be very clear on what your ultimate goal is. How is your energy mix evolving  over time? And I think that it is critical that we have sight of the fact that you will be able to rely  a lot more on renewable energy and reduce your reliance on gas I would specifically say,  because that is definitely a lot cleaner than coal.  Now, I'm also a big believer that you're going to have a number of solutions where you can  leapfrog sometimes, distributed generation, mini grids, rooftop solar. A lot of these costs  haven't come down enough to make them viable 24/7 but I think as we see technological  changes or advances in storage technologies, batteries, I think a lot of these are going to be  viable a lot sooner than we think they will be.  So it's a combination of factors. I'm personally a big believer in mini grids because they are  really concentrated and we've done some interesting work around them, around the world. So I  think we just also need to be practical. We just can't say that the person in a village in Nigeria or  India who may not have access to power 24/7 is that, hey - you don't deserve it. You're not  going to get it. And that's the business we're in.  There's a very interesting article in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago which said there's  a village next to an energy plant in Nigeria where they don't have access to power. I don't know  
if you saw that but that to me is, you know. So the country has gas, you're exporting it, but you  don't want to give it to your own citizens. I mean, I'm putting it simplistically. But the point I'm  trying to make is that I think we need to understand that you're going to have the need in some  markets for transition fuels. But as long as there's an ultimate goal of reaching net zero and  reducing your reliance on fossil fuels, I think that's the way it's going to work.  Elaine Fernandez:  Business has a financial obligation to investors and other stakeholders to ensure its long-term  viability. It also has a moral obligation to ensure the societies in which it operates thrive. In the  face of climate change and other existential threats, this means rebalancing business priorities  and partnering with government, civil society and other companies to mitigate risks and  generate sustainable solutions.

Principal Objective 3: Ensuring Moderate Prosperity

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Chandran Nair explained 'moderate prosperity', the third and final principal objective of the state. It emphasises the balance between achieving a comfortable standard of living and maintaining social and environmental responsibility.Moderate prosperity is a term coined by Deng Xiaoping, described as a comfortable standard of living that transcends mere survival but avoids the excesses of modern consumerism.Moderate prosperity has applications outside of China, as it can help governments ensure that wealth creation doesn't come at the expense of others. Economic success should not disenfranchise people or prevent others from thriving. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Principal Objective 3:   Ensuring Moderate Prosperity  Elaine Fernandez:  The third principal objective of the state is to ensure moderate prosperity.  This deals with issues like average income levels and economic inequality. These are some of the  most prominent topics focused on by governments and citizens alike, which is why it’s so  important that the State manages prosperity levels appropriately.  You’ll hear more about the third and final principal objective from GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran  Nair.  Chandran Nair:  The concept of moderate prosperity was coined by the then leader of China, Deng Xiaoping. His  vision of China was to uplift a billion Chinese out of poverty. But he at the same time realised that  that process would have to be managed in a way that allow Ch inese to prosper without  necessarily ruining it. He understood that not every Chinese could be wealthy in the same way  that was perhaps understood in the United States or in the West.  And at that time, in China actually started with the most basic food, safe and secure. People were  fed at least that basic right and that basic need for human beings would be fulfilled. But he also  understood that more than a billion Chinese, as it is now,   cannot aspire to have everything. So  he coined the phrase that we would aspire for an economy that would be one that afforded  moderate prosperity for all.  So what is moderate prosperity?  It's a comfortable standard of living. It's a standard of living that removes people from the  indignity of life. So what's the indignity of life? The indignity of life is not having meaningful work,  for one. The indignity of life is not having a safe home.   One in which you endure all the stresses  of weather conditions that you need to be protected from, where women feel safe under a roof,  they're secure. It's one in which people feel that they can at least enjoy some leisure.
  So it's higher than the basic standard of living. It's not hand to mouth, but it's lower than the  higher consumption, never - ending need for satisfaction that, unfortunately, is hardwired into our  economic model. And that needs to change.  The state needs to keep a plan open to allow this to be explained to people. So that every part of  the economy buys into the concept of moderate prosperity without thinking that it's necessarily  some society in which everyone is equal. Those things don't e xist. There will be wealthier people,  et cetera, but they do not create conditions in which their wealth creation is at the expense of  others.  If you work harder, you're entitled to a better salary, of course, but you can't work harder in ways  that you create economic outcomes that disenfranchise people or create conditions in which  other people can't thrive as well. And that's the moderate prosp erity.  Elaine Fernandez:  Moderate prosperity is not a new concept. It has been around in various forms for   centuries but  is especially relevant in today’s world.  It reminds us that we all have the right to a comfortable and dignified standard of living, but not  at the expense of other people or the planet. This is where the State comes in.  Through good governance and strategic planning, it can uplift society’s most vulnerable and  ensure that inequalities are reduced.

Democracy and China's Political Meritocracy

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we explored the concept of political meritocracy in China. Professor Danial Bell made the case that meritocracy may be more effective for selecting leaders capable of handling diverse and complex challenges, instead of solely relying on electoral democracy. Implementing policies in large democratic countries, especially those concerning sustainability, is challenging due to repeating electoral cycles. This contrasts with China's approach, where leaders can focus on long-term goals without immediate electoral pressures. China's lack of a rigid constitution allows for adaptability to rapidly changing societal needs, especially in the face of advancements like AI. This flexibility is essential for contemporary governance but also risks making current leaders unsuitable for future societal needs. In China, democratic mechanisms are effective at lower government levels where leaders are well-known to their communities. However, at higher levels, where policies become more complex, meritocratic mechanisms are deemed essential for selecting leaders with the required expertise and ability. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Democracy and China's Political Meritocracy  Elaine Fernandez:  China’s system of political meritocracy has become the subject of global interest. It is often pitted  against the democratic system in a contest of pros and cons.  To understand it further, you’ll hear from Professor Daniel Bell, who argues that political  meritocracy can enable the realisation of long - term   visions and   should be approached with an  open - mind.  Professor Daniel Bell:  So in a democracy, especially if it's a large country, it's very, very messy.   There are   so many  stakeholders that can exercise veto power on policies. So if the top level of public officials, let's  assume that they are committed to sustainable environmental policies, or policies that help  nature and help animals as well. But it's very, very   hard to implement those policies because  there's so many stakeholders and they're worried about the next elections and being thrown out  of power.  Now, in China, ideally, a policy would serve the interests of all those who are affected by the  policy. And in the case of China, it means future generations, it means the whole world on issues  like environmental policy. So to a certain extent, the leaders   have to have the power to ignore  the short - term interests or to block the short - term interests that block reform.  And I think it's in a political meritocracy where the leaders can take long - term horizons and not  worry so much about being thrown out of power in the next few years or being severely openly  criticised if   they attack certain stakeholders that block necessary reform, it's easier to implement  policies. I mean, one of the advantages of a political meritocracy is that it allows for tremendous  flexibility, right? I mean, think of a system that has a very strong   constitution that's hard to  change.
  Like the United States, they had a pretty good constitution in the 1780s and it worked well in the  1780s, and they could be confident that 50 years from then, for example, in the 1830s, it would  still be pretty much a good constitution because society wasn 't expected to change that much.  But what we have now, a system, changes so fast. I mean, think of how AI is going to radically  transform our way of life 20 or 30 years from now. Whatever works now as a political system is  not likely to work 20 or 30 years from now. So there's a need for   a tremendous amount of  flexibility. Now, it's good that China doesn't have a rigid constitution and that there's much more  emphasis on the quality of rule. But there is a risk that the leaders who think they're doing well  now are also appropriate for 20 or   30 years from now, which is highly unlikely, frankly, because  it's going to be a new society which requires different kinds of talent to deal with oppressing  challenges.  So in the West, including in Canada, where I'm from, there's a kind of assumption, frankly, it's a  bit of a dogmatic assumption that regardless of the size of government, there's only one way of  selecting leaders, and that's by means of elections. Whereas   in China, there's an assumption that  democratic mechanisms such as elections might work at lower levels of government, such as  villages. Villages tend to know who the leaders are. They tend to know who's corrupt, who's not.  They tend to know who has abilit y and who doesn't. But as you move towards higher levels of  government, the challenges are much more, well, diverse.  So for one thing, the policies are much more complex. I mean, that's how those governments just  think of the kinds of policies that must be decided. You know, they require knowledge of  economics, they require knowledge of international relations, they requ ire knowledge of  environmental science on issues like climate change. So it's much more important to have  meritocratic mechanisms to select and promote leaders at higher levels of government so that  they could make decisions that affect the long - term inter ests of the political community as well  as future generations.  The ideal of a kind of Chinese political system is that at lower levels of government, there would  be many democratic mechanisms, so that there's more feedback from the people and that the  public officials know what the people want and need. But as you mov e up the chain of political  command, it's important for there to be more meritocratic mechanisms so that the political  leaders have experience and ability to make complex decisions that affect diverse stakeholders.  Now, I think it's quite distinctive to large countries like China. I mean, in small countries, for  example, Denmark, population 5 million, the idea that you can have elections even at high levels
  of government may be acceptable because the issues are not that   complex,   and the citizens  perhaps have more knowledge of the leaders. And if Denmark makes mistakes on issues like  climate change, it's not the end of the world, whereas if China makes mistakes, I mean, it could  be the end of the world. So the stakes are much bigg er.  This view should not be controversial, actually. I mean, in the West, it was quite common until  World War II to allow for the possibility that democratic mechanisms work best at lower levels  of government. I mean, that was the view. For example, the French   political   theorist , Jean Jacque  Rousseau, even John Stuart Mill, the Great British liberal 19th century, I mean, he said, oh, we  have to make sure that we have competent leaders at the top. And that might mean, for example,  giving extra votes to educated voters. Now, that v iew would be pretty crazy now. For example, if  I were in Canada and to suggest that those with PhDs should have to vote, you know, people  would view this as a completely crazy view.  But in the 19th century there was a bit more openness in that sense regarding diverse  possibilities. I'm not endorsing John Stuart Mill’s view, but I'm just saying that it wasn't such a  dogmatic view about what is the only legitimate mechanism to select po litical leaders in  communities.  Elaine Fernandez:  China’s   system   of   political   meritocracy   has   democratic   mechanisms   at   lower   levels   of  government, while higher levels require more meritocratic mechanisms to select leaders with  the experience and ability to make complex decisions.  This works for China, because the country and its population are so large that its issues are more  complex, with higher stakes, requiring leaders who are better trained to exhibit long - term vision.

Responding to Freshwater Pollution: Mitigation and Adaptation

### keyTakeaway
Key approaches to addressing freshwater pollution include reducing agricultural runoff and improving water treatment technologies, and the restoration of natural habitats to enhance water quality.Preventing pollution at its source and enforcing strict wastewater disposal laws are essential for protecting freshwater resources.Investing in modern treatment technologies and natural filtration systems can significantly improve water quality and resilience against pollution.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  R esponding to Freshwater Pollution:  Mitigation and Adaptation  Olivia Lai:   With regard to pollution, there are several contemporary mitigation and  adaptation approaches that are being taken around the world. First and foremost is source  protection, which is a mitigation strategy. This means preventing pollution from entering  fre shwater sources in the first place, such as farms using fewer pesticides and fertilisers to  limit accidental seepage into waterways ,   or from recreational land - uses like holiday resorts  and golf courses.  Governments have an essential role to play here by mandating that businesses must strictly  control any   wastewater   they produce and dispose of it according to laws. In this regard,  enforcement is critical .   A ppropriate punitive measures go hand in hand with this. An essential  component of source protection is the need for robust monitoring and reporting. Having data  on water quality at different points along the freshwater supply chain is crucial. It can help  governments and businesses identify pollution sour ces and take action to address them  through early detection.  For example, as recently as the 1980s, Finland used to have cancer - causing materials in its  drinking water which its citizens termed ugly water. But with investment into overhauling its  freshwater management infrastructure coupled with policies that limite d pollution, Finland  now has the cleanest water in the world with only basic treatment needed.  Second is treatment and remediation of water sources and   wastewater   which is an adaptation  strategy. This essentially helps to remove pollutants from freshwater systems, industrial and  municipal wastewater treatment plants are the most widely used, which employ a range of  technologies including filtration and biological t o chemical remediation technologies.  Modern water and wastewater treatment technologies aim to achieve zero liquid discharge ,  in which clean water is recovered from domestic and industrial affluent. Singapore is another  fantastic example, given it generates 40% of its drinking water from recycled   wastewater .  But the first line of   defence   and by far the most important treatment and remediation systems  are actually entirely natural. Vegetation and soils of all kinds can help to improve the  resilience of freshwater systems to pollution by storing water through natural filtration  processes. T he provision of these ecosystem services is why the protection and restoration of  natural habitats are vital to maintaining the security and supply of   high - quality   water. This  can include protecting forests, water catchment are as, restoring wetlands and floodplains, as  well as planting suitable vegetation along the edges of rivers and lakes that act as buffer zones
  and   natural   filters.   Freshwater   pollution   demonstrates   why   it   is   so   important   for  governments, businesses, and civil societies to develop robust mitigation and adaptation  strategies.  We must create social and business norms that make polluting water sources as unacceptable  as possible, but we have to also be constantly alert to cleaning pollution to avoid causing harm  to people, businesses, and the environment.

Redesigning the Economy: Individual Action 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, John Perkins highlighted five essential questions we all should ask ourselves to navigate a fulfilling life and contribute to transforming the economy towards sustainability. First, to identify what brings lasting satisfaction in our lives, and not solely short-term gain. Second, to explore how one's pursuits can contribute to shifting from a death economy to a life economy. Third, to reflect on what major obstacles exist that prevent us from aligning our personal satisfaction with helping to create a life economy. Fourth, to confront personal perceptions of ourselves to better understand what personal changes can propel us forward. Fifth, to take consistent actions that work toward long-term goals.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning the Economy: Individual Action  Rohan Hazell:  The need for reshaped economic systems that accommodate   people,   and the planet is  increasingly recognised.  But how can individuals contribute to this shift?  John Perkins, author of the best - selling Confessions of an Economic Hitman, provides five pivotal  questions that guide us towards aligning our personal passions and professions with the  principles of a 'life economy'.  John Perkins:  There are five questions I would suggest everybody ask himself or herself. So, the first question  is: What is it I must want to do for the rest of my life? What would give me the greatest  satisfaction? Because that's the only thing that'll make you succes sful is satisfaction. And I would  answer that. I want to write. I love to write. I enjoy writing. I love to write. I have a friend who's  a carpenter, kind of the opposite end of the spectrum, and he'd say, I want to work with my hands  in wood.  The second question is: How do I do this in a way that transforms the death economy to a life  economy? And for me, I say, I write, I'm going to write about that. I want to inspire people to get  involved in that. That's what I write about. My carpenter frie nd said I only want to use sustainable  material.  The third question is: What's stopping me? What's holding me back? Now, as a writer, I could  say, well, I know I need to write every day, and I just don't have time. My carpenter friend would  say, well, my clients don't want to spend the extra money to buy   sustainable materials.  The fourth question is: When you confront that perception, how do you change it in a way that  allows you to move forward? So for the writer, it would be, well, I could turn the television off an  hour early, three or four nights a week and write and my carp enter friend say, well, I can tell my  customers that the extra price, if there is one, is not a cost, it's an investment in the future for  them and their kids and the future.
  And the fifth question is: What actions do I take? And of course, if you’re a writer, you got to  write. And I have to write every day, even if it's not writing to be published. I've written, you  know, thousands of pages for every one that I've probably hav en't ever published because like a  professional pianist, you go t to   keep practising or tennis player, whatever , you got   to   do it. And  my carpenter friend would, you know, you got to go out and build a cabinet here, a bookcase like  this one, or a house like this that   is   made out of sustainable materials and keep telling his clients  and their kids we   are   doing this in a sustainable way for the future.  So those are two   aspects. But the question is, what will bring me the most pleasure for the rest  of my life? Most satisfaction? How do I do this in a way that transforms death to a life economy?  What's stopping me? How do I turn that around and what actions do I take? And   it doesn't matter  what your job is, what your career is, what your love of life is. Those three.  Those five questions can take you down a course that   will   be very good for you personally and  for the planet.  Follow your heart. Do what your heart tells you to do,   and figure out how to do that in a way that  transforms the death economy to a life economy.  Those five questions, again, it's, you know, you got to follow your heart because if you, if you  don't, you   will   burn out. And if you burn out, that's no good for anybody. And so, follow your  heart and do what brings you the greatest joy, the greatest pleasure. Realise that, you know, like  a good meal afterwards, you go t to   wash the dishes.  So there's always, you know, as a writer, I love to write, but there's aspects of it. Some of the  editing aspects of it, I don't love quite as much as the others, but I realise you got to do them. So,  I think truly the best advice I can give is to follow y our heart and I speak from personal experience  as well as you know, what I think is the best for the overall environment from what I've  experienced with other people.  And I think we can say that we live at a blessed time. This is a time with tremendous opportunity  to move into a whole new view of what it means to be human on this planet. What does it mean  to be successful? What does it mean to be living as a part of nat ure, not apart from nature? We've  too long, we've lived as apart from nature.
  Let's understand that we are a part of nature. We're not separate. We're part of nature. And  we're coming to that understanding. And so I think people listening to this, especially younger  people, what an incredible time you're, what an incredible time you 're growing up in and feel  blessed to be participating in this grand adventure that is being a human being at this point in  history and having the opportunity to turn things around.  Rohan Hazell:  John Perkins’ five questions ask us to critically examine how each of us contributes to society.  As he’s suggested, there are many opportunities for individuals to participate in redesigning our  economies by exercising their rights as citizens and consumers to hold governments and  companies accountable for their policies and business practices.

Approaches to Multistakeholder Decision-Making in the UAE

### keyTakeaway
H.E. Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri delved into how the UAE’s strategic decision-making for developing a circular economy has been improved by a multistakeholder approach that swiftly responds to the needs of citizens, local government, and the private sector.For effective decision-making, the UAE's circular economy policy was developed following an extensive national study, aligning institutional ecosystems with sustainable development goals to understand current standings and future objectives.The policy's success hinges on engaging diverse stakeholders, including government, private sector, and NGOs. The formation of the Circular Economy Council and a bottom-up approach were crucial for gaining insights and consensus from stakeholders.The UAE's approach underlines the necessity of viewing policymakers as designers who must continuously review and dynamically adapt policies. This approach is crucial in a rapidly changing global context where challenges emerge with increasing frequency and impact.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Approaches to Multi - stakeholder  Decision - Making in the UAE  Rohan Hazell :  As economies around the world begin the transition from a linear to a circular model, what  governance norms should be used to make this transformation smooth, inclusive, and  effective?  The United Arab Emirates is one country that has demonstrated success on this front. To find  out how its decision - makers navigated the complexity of initiating a circular economy in the  UAE, we speak with His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister   of Economy.  His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri:  First of all, the circular economy policy was adopted by following a very comprehensive study.  That's the first thing we did to conduct on the national level, in which we took in consideration  the institutional ecosystem for the circular economy, the overa ll vision, the goals, the multiple  stakeholders   involved, and complete alignment with the SDGs.  So we had to align on the top level to see where we stand. Where are we at the moment?  How different is the national level from the local levels? Where are the goals and where  actually are we in achieving them, as well on the SDG level. Since we adopted th e policy, the  Ministry of Economy has introduced five   legislations   to support   these implementations of  policy .  Before proceeding with the policy implementation, the council was formed in order to  supervise and support the implementation of the Circular Economic Policy Committee. And  the   committee   has   a   representative   of   stakeholder   from   federal   government,   local  go vernment, private sector, and NGOs. So we managed to cover the whole spectrum.  From the very beginning, the council has adopted a   bottom - up   approach, like we mentioned,  opening the doors to the private sector and until date as well, we are adding more and more  members to the council from the private sector.
  As soon as a year that we are actually developing, we're working on, we get   calls,   and we get  people who want to actually be part of this. And we have partners like Nestle, we have  PepsiCo, Michelin, General Motors from transportation, BN, Viola Infrastructure, and Tetra  Park from manufacturing.  So it's really some of the biggest names out there that participate in the council deliberation  and decisions. So we see international multinational companies that are part of our council.  And they are supporting and thinking about the challenges that we s ee. So having a more  consensual and more cross - sectoral approach can ease the policy implementation and the  acceptance of constant decisions.  But we did something which is very important. We did workshops. That over the last nine  months. So before going to the council and just sitting in a, in a, in a council meeting, we had  half a day's workshops, early breakfasts where we sat and we just spoke   and we allowed the  private sector to give their challenges, to vent, to speak about solutions, and we managed to  do that over the last, about nine months now, since the beginning of the year. And when we  come into the council meetings, all the challenges   that has been done in the workshop have  been addressed over there and the practicality of it, and we manage to merge it.  And one thing we understood back then as well is how do we involve the private sector? How  do you involve the right stakeholders, the communities, bringing everybody in, because  everyone has a different viewpoint that allows you to design visions and strat egies, the ways  that it should be.  The incorporation of externalities of the private sector can really and simply be start with  their involvement in the   decision - making   process.  And the innovation and creativity to internalise some of the negative externalities can also  provide such benefits and added value. I'm talking about the positive externality policies just  as developing new technology or standard that can really have appli cational benefit on other  areas. Maybe you heard as well the UAE have announced the corporate tax, and its  implementation will happen next year in June. At the moment, there is a lot of discussion as  well on what could be incentivising approach to reduce o f our tax rebates, or tax reduction  approach if companies adopt new advanced technologies research and circular economy is  really a big part of that as well.  How can we really incentivize corporates in the UAE by reducing some of the challenges on  corporate tax that will be introduced next year? And how do we really do that? As well, we've  seen the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and followed by Dubai and Sharjah. They st arted to ban the  use of single use plastics, for instance, by charging for each plastic bag used.  This measure as well also provides a second source of revenues for the business to reinvest  in sustainable production and processes for example. This is, by the way, another area for
  direct collaboration with the private sector where food and beverage producers are defining  detail and providing new standards of plastic recycle.  That's something which is important as well, to look at that aspect and to be very vulnerable  and to be very accessible. This is something that we've done in the last two and a half years  in the ministry, we are very accessible to the private sector. We ar e very vulnerable to  understand that if we make a mistake, we can actually amend and change.  We are very close to the social part of it as well. And we really listen to things. I remember  one thing when Covid 19, one of my lessons is when we started the private sector back then  virtually as well, like we're doing today. But I think I said, what re ally worries you in the UAE  economy?  The next short term, a month or so they said to us very simply is, do not keep us in the dark.  Please communicate with us. Please let us know what you guys are going to do before it  happens. Do not let us know if things are   going to   happen in the   news,   we   want to   know  beforehand so we can adapt as well with you on things that you might take as measures to  protect the health of people.  This was a lesson learned for us. And from then we had communication briefs every week to  the private sector on a national level, on a ministry level. I, myself as well, communicate a lot  with the private sector in meetings to make sure that whatever we're   going to do as decisions  is communicated.  Now, whether or not they like it, it's   communicated,   and they know   up hand   what's going to  happen next week or the week after that. This is something that we learned is how do you  communicate very clearly? How do you communicate in a way that it addresses the challenges  to help both economy and the policy makers and everybody in   the economy and the  stakeholder in the country as well adapt to it.  And I think the most important aspect in any leader in the region, each and every one of you  guys are designers. And I think it's important for us to really think about how to redesign  things and how do we make sure that we are very agile in our designs.  Now, when we ended up maybe beginning of this year looking at a very active approach on  where the economy is going   -   geopolitics and geoeconomics appears. Now we are hit again  with all those challenges. We are hit again as well with inflation, for instance , by where we  might hit again, maybe with an economy recession globally in the next year or so. So, the  challenges in the economy, the world wasn’t going to end.  So what does it mean for us in the MENA region? I think what it means is that policy makers  need to have this kind of vision in the future and look at themself as designers. How do we
  redesign the policies that we had? Maybe a policy we have set today can really need to be  redesigned in the next two years, maybe in three years.  And how can we become very dynamic? I always say it as well that if we design a policy and  it takes two years, three years for us to actually start to implement. From first three months,  we need to look at redesign. Because this is a   three - year   data that maybe changed and the  problem that we are designing the policy for that maybe doesn't exist.  So that kind of thinking is important to look at, review the approaches on tackling these  challenges and the world is going to live in these challenges   -   where now is going to come  even more faster and at a very high impact. I think compared to two decades   ago, where  challenges used to be coming in like in a four years or five   years’ time   frame, now we see  challenges coming in within six months frames. And I think it's important to really have that  kind of entrenched dynamic policymaker inside each and every one of us to adapt to it.  Rohan Hazell:  The   UAE’s   success   in   redesigning   its   economy   is   largely   thanks   to   forward - looking  policymaking, powered by effective cross - sector collaboration.  By making itself accessible, and by inviting dialogue with business and civil society, the  government was able to ease tensions, meaning stakeholders felt included in the decision -  making process. His Excellency also pointed to agility, responsiveness and e mpathy as being  critical skills for redesigning society.  All of these factors combined to move the UAE closer to its intended goal of implementing a  circular economy.

Externalities Mapping: Practice Activity 

### keyTakeaway
This module introduced the Externalities Mapping tool - a practical framework that can be used to identify the “hidden costs” of doing business that are borne by society and the environment. Externalities mapping can help companies understand where in their value chains these negative impacts are occurring and facilitate the development of appropriate strategies and measures to address them.The first checkpoint in externalities mapping is to understand the overall value chain for key products and services, starting with three “upstream” and three “downstream” activities.In the second checkpoint, we identify externalities at these various links in the chain, and consider their impact on three groups of stakeholders:People including consumers, communities, and wider society;The organisation, including employees and others along the value chain, like vendors and even the government; The environment, which includes the air, land, water, flora and fauna.The third checkpoint is to brainstorm solutions to reduce or remove the impact of these identified externalities.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Externalities Mapping: Practice Activity  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are the “hidden costs” of doing business that are borne by society and the  environment.  Some externalities are clear and obvious, but because they are not priced into products or  services, others can be much harder to identify.  Given the damage they can cause, it is critical that we are able to recognise externalities where  and when they occur, so appropriate measures can be taken to address them.  Externalities Mapping provides a clear framework for doing just this. It can be applied in any  industry to identify and assess the impact of externalities on different stakeholders at various  points along the value chain.  This framework can also be used to determine positive externalities, but in this practice activity,  we will focus on negative ones, and guide you through the three checkpoints of Externalities  Mapping, using the oil and gas industry as an example.  Rohan Hazell:  Checkpoint One – Understanding the Value Chain  The first checkpoint in externalities mapping is understanding the value chain, starting with  three upstream and three downstream activities.  Upstream refers to activities that take place to produce a good or service, like resource  extraction, manufacturing, and transportation. In the oil and gas industry, this might involve the  transportation of oil from an offshore rig to the terminal, or even the production and assembly  of the oil rig itself.  
Downstream   activities   occur   once   a good or service has been produced, like sales and  marketing, distribution, consumption and disposal. In the oil and gas industry, this can involve  the use of petroleum in cars, or the conversion of oil into high value chemical products.  Checkpoint Two – Mapping Externalities  At checkpoint Two we identify the externalities at one upstream and one downstream link in  the chain, and consider their impact on three groups of stakeholders:  people   including consumers, communities, and wider society,  the organisation   including employees and others along the value chain, like vendors and even  the government., and  the environment   which includes the air, land, water, flora and fauna.  In the oil and gas industry, externalities upstream impact the three stakeholder groups in the  following ways:  During extraction, oil leaks and exposure to toxic substances present health risks for nearby  communities. Workers who spend months at a time on rigs may suffer mental stress from being  offshore for so long.  Oil spills can devastate the ecosystem, killing fish, birds, and many kinds of marine life. Further  downstream, the exhaust fumes from cars and other vehicles using petroleum increases the risk  of respiratory illness.  Rising demand for petroleum also impacts the government, by increasing the fuel subsidy they  must provide.  Lastly, CO2 production from vehicles also damages the environment by contributing to global  warming.  Remember, as with all externalities, the common feature of these impacts is that none of them  are priced into production or consumption.  Checkpoint Three – Brainstorming Solutions  
The final checkpoint is brainstorming a solution to reduce or remove the impact of one  externality you have identified.  To generate this solution, consider three things:  1. Is it possible to reduce the impact by modifying the business model, or the specific activity  that led to this particular externality? How could this be achieved?  2. What else can the company do to lessen the impact? Can it partner with another organisation  or acquire new capabilities to manage this externality?  3. Will new policy and regulations be needed to address this externality? What kind?  To illustrate the type of solution you might generate, here is an example from the externality of  health risks associated with inhaling fumes from vehicles using petroleum:  1. Oil and gas players can partner with automotive companies to increase investment into  electric vehicle businesses.  Or  2. Governments can pass a policy that mandates all public transport to be electrically powered.  Alternatively, they can apply congestion charges to prevent the build-up of cars and harmful  fumes in one locale.  These are high-level examples – you can and should be as creative and detailed as possible with  your own solutions!  Elaine Fernandez:  Now that we have walked through the practice activity, its time to complete your own  Externalities Map, this time for the Electric Vehicle industry. To recap:  At Checkpoint 1, you will consider the upstream and downstream links in the Electric Vehicle  value chain.  At Checkpoint 2, you will identify the negative externalities that occur at two links in the chain.  
At Checkpoint 3, you will brainstorm a solution that addresses one of the externalities you have  identified.  All   the   information   you   need   to   complete   this   activity,   including   articles   and   relevant  information on the Electric Vehicle industry, can be found in the data pack.  Finally, download a blank Externalities Mapping Tool and apply it to your own industry or  organisation.

Moving Beyond Common Framings of the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Wang Hui delved into the importance of solidarity among nations and the need for a truly global perspective to navigate the complexities of a post-Western world.Geopolitical “alliances” may be too black and white for a multipolar world, and can lead to a domino effect when conflict occurs. Instead, “solidarity” between nations demonstrates international cooperation without needing to be involved in extra-national conflicts.The success of non-Western nations in achieving economic growth and independence demonstrates alternative trajectories to modernisation beyond Western frameworks.Adopting a global perspective, particularly in education and media, is imperative to balance the prominence of Western-centric narratives and promote understanding across cultures.It is incumbent upon Western nations to encourage solidarity among non-Western countries rather than opposing or undermining it.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Moving Beyond Common Framings of the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  Two of the biggest questions posed about the shift to a post-Western world are what will  happen to the nature of globalisation and how will international cooperation change? There are  many theories.  On the one hand, it has been argued that as non-Western nations rise in power, globalisation as  we know it will come to an end with nations becoming more protectionist and divided.  For example, many commentators fear that the rise of large powerful nations like China may  result in conflict between the old and new world orders. But as Professor Wang Hui of Tsinghua  University in Beijing points out, these theories are based on 20th century understandings of the  world and the changes to globalisation and international cooperation will be far more nuanced.  He helps to clarify that the post-Western world will be characterised by solidarity and a more  inclusive set of global structures both for trade and geopolitics.  Professor Wang Hui:  The post-Western order differs from the end of history and the clash of civilisation theories I  think. We know that “the end of history” as a theory was raised by Francis Fukuyama in 1989  and then later he developed it into a book. And basically he thought that after the collapse of  the Soviet Union as the Eastern European socialist order or the bloc, there was kind of the trend  to move towards liberal democracy plus the market economy, which means the end of the  history.  So basically these are evolutionary processes towards the end of history. He tried to argue for  that. As for the clash of civilisations by Huntington, it was raised after the end of the so-called  Cold War. And basically he thought that before that there was a clash between the nation  states, between the ideologies and all these kinds of conflicts. What replaces that will be the  clash of civilisations. The culture and the civilisation identity become the key concepts to  describe the clash in the future. But obviously here, the end of history, a lot of the people  
criticise that theory because in the last decades we perceived the deep crisis within the  dominant political system, not only in other places but also within the West. Even Francis  Fukuyama himself described that as a political decay.  And as for the clash of civilisations, of course, a lot of the descriptions and analysis focused on  the Western and the Islamic war, and so on and so forth. But nevertheless, if you look at the  trade war or other technology war and Russian-Ukraine war, it's difficult to use that framework  to analyse it. So there were deep self-contradictions within these theories.  When we talk about the transition to post-Western world order, I think that we should go back  to think about the whole history of the 19th century, 20th century up to now because the  theory of the end of the history actually implies that the whole failure of the socialist  movement and the national liberation movements and so on and so forth. But actually, here we  can see that in the 20th century, especially in the second half of the 20th century, many  countries like China, India, achieved their independence through different ways, decolonisation,  Chinese revolution and so on and so forth, and developed their own way for industrialisation.  So you can see, for example, in Asia, many other countries developed their economy. China,  India, Japan, Korea and many Southeast Asian countries, those countries are very different,  meaning culturally, politically, and their social structures are very different. However, what's  common between them is that they dislike going back to colonial times. They threw their  struggles for their own independence, so that I think created the basis for accelerating the  transition to the post-Western world order.  So I remember that some scholars also used the term post-colonialism, but now, if you look at  the Western countries, in Europe, America, the cultures, political elements or any others, and  also especially economically, the Western monopoly to the large extent was weakened. So  people also talk about the post-western era coming. So in that sense, it transformed the whole  world's structures.  Of course, it's difficult, because if you look at the current situation, especially the American  economic, technological policy, and obviously they want to keep their own monopoly and  domination in the world. So that was the reason for so many geopolitical conflicts continuing.  So in that sense, the Asian, African countries together with Latin America, are staying together  for solidarity. For example, since 1955, the Bandung Conference, there were a series of efforts  for coexistence and to maintain peace. So that's the effort. It's obvious there.  
We should recognise that we came from the long process in the 19 - 20th century, which was  dominated by the Western culture. It is the process. So, for example, in our education system,  most of the knowledge paradigm, framework, we learned mainly from the West.  So in that sense, our knowledge about our own society, sometimes also shaped by that kind of  social science framework, humanities framework and theory and so on and so forth. We need  to have a reflection on that.  Second, we should recognise that we are quite ignorant about the countries and the cultures,  especially the non-Western cultures, because we are more or less familiar with the Western  history and the narratives dominated by Western narratives about other parts of the world.  However, we have no experience and still few people really have the capacity to communicate  with   the   people   from   the   different   cultural   backgrounds.   So   we   need   to   enhance the  cooperation   and   the   communication,   interaction   between   the   countries,   especially   the  non-Western countries.  So in that sense, first of all, we change our mind and change our knowledge and then develop a  more real, cosmopolitan, real international perspective to think about our own self. So the  self-identity is also based on the richness, how rich that you can look upon you from different  perspectives. So more communications like a South-South dialogues are very important and a  chance to do some reform in our education curriculum and so on and so forth.  Following the deepening process of your mutual understanding, I think that will be very helpful  for the development of these kind of political economic cooperation and communications.  Rohan Hazell:  Common framings of the post-Western world are overly simplistic. It is clearly not the case, for  example,   that   any   political,   economic   or social system could represent the endpoint of  humanity's development. Nor are Western and non-Western nations destined to engage in  conflict as the latter rise in power.  Non-Western countries are increasingly seeking solidarity with one another and Western  nations now have a responsibility to encourage this rather than rejecting or undermining it.  Now, these geopolitical shifts can seem too big-picture to be connected to the average person  like you or I.  
But Professor Wang Hui reminds us to move beyond theory. Education around the world, for  example, is still heavily influenced by Western systems and approaches. Equally, non-Western  cultures are often not well understood due to a lack of representation in education and media.  This impacts us all, regardless of what part of the world you are from. So if you are to develop a  truly global perspective, it is important to enrich yourself with knowledge from other nations.  This will enable greater understanding and empathy at the individual level and greater political  and economic cooperation at the national level.

Redesigning Business: Stakeholder Engagement and Communication 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that a business's long-term viability is contingent on its ability to communicate and engage with its stakeholders and shareholders.The tradeoff between short-term returns versus long-term viability is becoming a necessary consideration for organisations, and it is important to remain transparent with stakeholders on the motivations and objectives behind these decisions.Meaningful engagement and careful communication with stakeholders is therefore paramount to managing expectations and addressing concerns regarding any transformations a business may seek to undertake.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Business: Stakeholder Engagement  and Communication  Elaine Fernandez:  Who are our business stakeholders? This can vary from those in the supply chain, such as  suppliers and employees, to governments and investors and even local communities. As each  stakeholder has a different set of expectations and concerns, navigating their unique interests  and contributions requires a deeper understanding of their needs.  Vivek Pathak, Global Head and Director of Climate Business at the International Finance  Corporation or the IFC, shed some light on the complexities of stakeholder engagement.  Vivek Pathak:  I don't think there's a straightforward answer to that. Is it the role of the government or the  private sector? So I think what is the role of government is to really say, where can you attract  private capital and what will it take to attract that private capital?  So if you look at it, what is it investors want? Investors want contracts that are enforceable.  They want transparency. They want a fair risk reward. And a very big risk that we saw in  emerging markets is risk of land acquisition. So how do you de risk that? So governments can  help with a lot of those areas.  Now, when it comes to access, there's a concept called "PPPs" but I think I would love to add a  fourth "P" to it, which is "Public Private Partnerships for People." You have to make it affordable.  Sometimes the private sector can do that. Sometimes the risk-reward is not there. So that's  where you have to have a government intervention in making sure it's affordable. There's no  point in having access to energy if a villager can't afford it. There's no point in having a bridge  over a river if people can't afford to pay if it's a toll road. So I think affordability is key.  Now, affordability can happen in many ways. The government can do it itself. You can have the  private sector do it and the government sort of, you get a pot of capital to subsidise certain  parts of it, and that's not uncommon. It's quite common in many markets to have different rates  
of energy depending on consumption for the industrial sector, for individuals. So it's not  uncommon. But there is no one-size-fits-all. We have to really look at the circumstances and  have a tailor made solution. So I think it's hard to generalise.  Now, clearly, I think in a number of markets, the government and the private sector are  collaborating   to   make   this   change happen. It's hard to say that people don't trust the  government or people don't trust the private sector. The actions that people are taking today  will take some time, unfortunately, so people will see the results of that action which is being  taken today. But I'll come back to what I said earlier is, do you really want to be listed amongst  the top ten companies on the Nasdaq or the Dow 20 years from now, or do you want to be out  of it? It's as simple as that for you. I'm making it very simple. I know it's not that simple. But the  message is clear that you have to take actions today, whether it's with the government or on  your own, to do things which will make sure that your medium and long-term viability remains  intact. And again, it's really a tussle between short-term returns versus long-term viability.  That's the way I like to put it.  And sometimes..I met somebody the other day, very large producer who's big into green  hydrogen, Andrew Forrest. And I think this is public information. He said, "I announced, I think,  a $6 billion decarbonisation plan. My stock price tanked." That's a lot of debt you're taking on.  He said, "That's okay. But I know five years from now, my mining operations are going to be  close to net zero emissions in terms of the actual operations. So my energy costs are going to  come down very significantly. Four or five years from now, I'm going to be laughing all the way  to the bank, I suspect." I'm putting words in his mouth, but that's what he implied, and that's so  right.  So my view is there are short-term investors and there are medium to long-term. And I think if I  was a CEO of a large corporation today, I would have to balance both. I'm not for a minute  saying, as a  CEO, don't worry about the short-term investors. So you need to communicate in a way that's  effective, so people understand what the results of your actions are. I think that is critical. If I  was the CEO of the top five banks, like I said, it's not an easy choice to make. Again, it's about  what you believe. And there are banks who are doing it today. There are a number of banks  who've announced targets who are working towards it. There will be short term hiccups, I think  we need to acknowledge that. But I don't think there's a straight answer for that, to be honest,  there is no straight answer because markets can be predatory at times. That's the nature of the  beast.  
So we have to really balance and say, okay, but what is the benefit of having markets which are  open, which are transparent and which are effective and which work? What I clearly think is not  good is if markets are closed and access to capital is not democratised. That I think is clearly not  good. But otherwise, I think for a lot of the players that's the dilemma. But again, if you plan on  being the CEO not for 18 months but for 5 years, I think you should be able to communicate to  your stakeholders, and I say stakeholders, not just shareholders: What is your thinking? Why are  you doing it? And be able to articulate the benefits clearly so that people understand why  you're taking certain actions and why you headed in a certain trajectory.  For a number of banks, DBS was a leader many years ago to focus on digital. That meant  significant upfront investments and I think the results are clear. The banks that did not focus on  going digital are today, I would argue, suffering probably. So JP Morgan went that way, a number  of big banks went that way. But they were able to, I think, communicate to their shareholders  what they're doing and why they're doing it, and the benefits are clear.  So I think the climate transition is going to be no different, I hope.  Elaine Fernandez:  The global landscape is shifting and the trade-off between short-term versus long-term viability  is becoming a necessary consideration for organisations. As strategies shift to account for this  new reality, it is important to remain transparent with stakeholders on the motivation and  objectives behind these decisions.  Meaningful engagement and careful communication with stakeholders are therefore paramount  to managing expectations and addressing concerns regarding any transformations business may  seek to undertake.

Major Areas for Transformation in the Post-Western World 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair explored the areas of transformation that are crucial in the shift to a post-Western world, from multilateral institutions to arts and culture.A post-Western world requires greater inclusivity in multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations Security Council, to ensure that non-Western nations have a say in global decision-making processes.Given that much of the world’s financial architecture is dominated by Western institutions, there is a need for new protocols and standards to allow non-Western countries and institutions to play a more significant role.The education system, particularly in commonwealth countries, must undergo curriculum reforms to include more accurate and inclusive historical narratives, reflecting the experiences and cultures of local populations.With non-Western cultures gaining more prominence and appreciation in the transition to multipolarity, their influence on all arenas of global arts and culture will only increase.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Major Areas for Transformation in the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  Just as the dawn of the rules-based world order ushered in a new era of sovereignty, the advent  of a post-Western world will similarly require transformation in ways that we may still take for  granted. So, what are the areas for transformation going to be this time around?  To shed more light on this, let’s hear from Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed.  Chandran Nair:  We need to allow other nations to have a stake in defining what that future of the world looks  like. And that's what we mean by de-Westernisation of the rules-based order. An example of  that on the multilateral system would be the obvious need to include a country like India in the  Security Council. There's only five nations in there, and it doesn't include India. The only Asian  country in that is China. There is no African nation in it. So you might include India and have the  African Union. And take it from what's called the P5 to the P7.  That would be a fair world, that's a new operating system. But in other areas would be things  like in business. So much of the financial architecture of the world is dominated by Western  institutions. This is not to say that they are not good, or that they are not competent, or that  they are intrinsically bent on exploiting others and serving their own needs. It is essentially a  system failure. A failure of the old institutions where people didn't think of including others.  You know, if you went back to the 1940s, these were seen as poor nations. The way of thinking  about them was that they were backward, they were not developed, and they needed aid from  richer countries because they were colonies. So if you look at the business environment, the  financial infrastructure of the world, much of it is controlled by Western institutions. I mean the  leading accounting firms are all   Western firms. We need a world in which we are not held  hostage by a monopoly of four Western accounting firms. When you want to do an IPO, when  you want to do your audits, or when there's any need to investigate forensically, financial crime,  et cetera, and it can't be the only ones to be trusted with setting the rules and standards. Many  of   them   have failed repeatedly. Not because they are bad people, but when you have  monopolies and you have them so large, they are prone to essentially doing things that they  can't manage, they're too big. So you could have a system in which the G20, through a system  
that they can negotiate, will make sure that from four firms that are allowed to participate as  gatekeepers of the global financial system, as the only trusted ones, there will be another six to  make it ten over the next 7 years.  So by 2030, that would be representation for at least one or two firms from Asia. One Indian,  one Chinese, maybe one from Singapore, Japan. Two from Africa, two from the Middle East.  So you start building those out and then you say by 2040 there'll be twenty firms against all  standards. It's all these protocols and standards can be set up so that we're not left thinking that  in 30 years we still just got four accounting firms who, unfortunately, are also closely related to  all other aspects of the global financial system, which is dominated by the Western banks. So it's  the banks, it's the rating agencies, it's the lawyers, you name it.  And that is one example of de-Westernisation. Not replacing but complementing, adding,  making it more equitable.  Another area that I could mention is also education. Much of our education, if you were born in  the Commonwealth countries, which is part of the British Empire, is based on a curriculum that  is completely outdated. The telling of history doesn't even have a discussion about what  actually happened in Africa during colonial rule. Terrible things happened. This has all been  brushed aside. What happened in India? The rewriting of history, which would frame Churchill's  intervention in India in a different way. Not to criminalise for the sake of it, but to get to the  truth so people understand what happened.  So history is a very important area where we would start to think about this in terms of  de-Westernisation. There are many thoughts from the West which we should really be learning  from many good things. But the world now cannot be so naive as to assume the good ideas only  come from a small segment of the human population. And all of you, learners from all parts of  the world, including Europe and the United States, will need to recognise that the great ideas  coming out of Africa, India, Indonesia, Bolivia, all of those countries, and those should be  allowed space and time.  And then there's other areas of culture. There are cultural norms in many countries that have  essentially been suffocated because of that 400 - 500 years of Westernisation of the world. And  I cover many areas, from how we look at music right through to culture, because as we  progress, I would like to see us live in a world where we appreciate the great cultures of the  world and not see, you know, music from Chile or from the Sunda Straits as something exotic  that only some people listen to because they're cool. It's actually the great music of the world.  And this should all be shared. And I even talk about how institutions involved in sports like the  Olympics, need to be reformed. For those of you who are interested, I think there's something  like 34 or 35 international sporting bodies that govern all the sports that participate in the  Olympics. And at the moment, I think there's only one of them that is based out of Asia. And  the rest of them, none based in Africa. Some of the greatest athletes are of African descent,  
none based in Africa. They're all based in either Europe or the United States. That needs to  change too.  So if you talk about cycling in the Olympics, particularly in a velodrome or something like that,  well, most countries in the world do not have such an expensive facility. But if you continue to  reward the countries that participate in those expensive sports, then you continuously start to  send a message to poorer countries, et cetera. You can't compete with us. And that has a huge  impact on how the people think about their relationship with power and the West, et cetera. So  those are the areas, it's business, it's geopolitics, it's culture, it's education, it's even sports.  And I do talk about environmental issues as well.  Rohan Hazell:  A post-Western world means changes across several major areas.  In geopolitics, multilateral institutions will have to do better at including non-Western nations in  decision and policy-making.  In business and finance, new protocols and standards will be required to make it easier for  non-Western companies to contribute and shape global business practices.  In education, decolonisation of curriculums and teaching styles in former colonies will be  needed to make them more rooted in local cultures and history.  Lastly, cultures around the world will shift, including in the sports we play, the clothes we wear,  and the media we consume.  Collectively, this will create space for a revival of non-Western cultures to a place of equal  footing with the dominant cultures of Europe and the US.

Critical Challenges Facing Civil Society

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Karim Rushdy spoke on the complexity of challenges faced by civil society organisations, including resource limitations, ethical concerns, and the need for transparency.Civil society organisations often face limitations in financial and human resources, impacting their work scope, especially during economic crises like COVID-19.The assumption that civil society is inherently altruistic isn’t always the case: CSOs are also susceptible to unethical behaviour such as self-serving collaborations with businesses, like lobbying.Astroturfing involves creating fake grassroots organisations funded by businesses to manipulate public opinion, underscoring the need for transparency in civil society activities.International civil society groups wield influence but can carry cultural biases, requiring an understanding of local contexts to avoid imposing external values.Collaboration among civil society, business, and government is crucial, and needs independent oversight to ensure integrity, examining funding sources and potential conflicts of interest.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Critical Challenges Facing Civil Society  Host:  In the final chapter of this core module, we’ll explore the critical challenges facing civil society.  As organisations that sit outside the public and private sectors - often without sufficient or  regular sources of funding - civil societies can suffer from major operational difficulties.  Even when civil society organisations are well established, well funded and have an  international presence, they can still face a different kind of challenge: that of ethical dilemmas.  Let’s hear more of these dilemmas from Karim Rushdy, former managing director at GIFT and  advisor to GIFT.ed.  Karim Rushdy:  So civil society faces a lot of challenges when it comes to ethical concerns, when it comes to  funding and financing. And these challenges are, are not going away. If anything, they're  becoming magnified, given the changes that we're seeing in the world.  So it's really important for people in civil society, of course, to be aware of these challenges and  to work towards resolving them. But it's also really important for people in business and  government to understand the challenges facing civil society so that they can support and help  civil society to fill some of these gaps, it being such an important pillar of our societies.  So the first challenge, I think, would be in terms of resources. Generally speaking, civil society  are much more constrained when it comes to resources, financial resources, human resources.  So that limits the scope of the work that they can do as compared with business and  government. Financing can really compromise the mission. If funding either dries up and given  the economic crises that we face periodically at those times, people tend to tighten their belts.  So during COVID for example, funding globally really dried up for charities and NGOs.  
Likewise, if financing is tied to certain agenda of donors, that can be very difficult for CSOs when  they're co-opted. Because of the limited resources that CSOs have, they often need to make  quite difficult decisions. They can't do everything. So prioritising becomes very, very important.  It's challenging to decide where to allocate time, money and energy when all of those three  things are limited. So just as there's a misperception that civil society is not influential, not  powerful, and it's okay to ignore it, there's also a misperception that all civil society  organisations must be a force for good. They're do gooders, they're purpose driven, they're  helping to fill gaps, they're supporting the vulnerable. And of course, for the most part this is  true.  But civil society at the end of the day, is made up just as business and government are of groups  of human beings, and human beings are prone to bad behaviour from time to time. And civil  society is certainly not immune to this unethical behaviour. There are a few ways that business  and civil society collaborate together, which is very detrimental and can have very negative  outcomes.  Probably the most prominent and widely known example would be that of lobbying. Oftentimes  business will use civil society groups to push policies that are not good for society as a whole. So  there was an example several years ago now in the United States, where an institute was set up  at one of the universities in Colorado and started to put out research and data that was basically  saying what you consume in terms of calories and the kind of food you consume is not that  important. What's much more important is that you exercise, that you lead a healthy, active  lifestyle. Now, it actually came out later that that institute was set up and funded by the  Coca-Cola company. So that completely tainted all of the research that they had done.  It led to a lot of bad PR for not just the institute, but for Coca-Cola. And it really kind of shone a  spotlight on the fact that we need to be very, very careful and we shouldn't just take, what, just  because it's a civil society organisation, just because it's an NGO, just because it's an academic  institute, we should always look behind and see where is the funding coming from? What are  the intentions of these organisations? Who are they collaborating with? How involved is  business? How involved are their donors in the work that they do and the ideas that they put  out there? A phenomenon that's occurred with the dawn of the Internet age is something called  "astroturfing".  So Astroturf, we know, is that fake grass, the plastic grass that is used on sports pitches so that  you can play sports in any weather conditions. Astroturfing in this context is when fake  grassroots organisations are created, often created and funded by business interests, either by a  
single company or by an industry association or a consortium of companies. And those fake  grassroots organisations go online and try to change the narrative and make certain arguments  appear to have popular support.  So many countries in the last decade have made moves to ban plastic bags, for example. Now  there was the rise of many of these fake grassroots organisations, which was set up by plastic  bag producers and industry associations of plastic bag producers to criticise the fact that plastic  bags were being banned, to criticise the fact that consumers were being made to pay for plastic  bags, and to try and stoke up some negative sentiment against these policies, against these  regulations. So a more kind of nuanced issue when it comes to the ethics of civil society is  international civil society organisations operating around the world. And today there are  countless, kind of global brands when it comes to civil society. So we mentioned a couple  earlier, WWF, Oxfam, Save the Children, Greenpeace. Movements now like Black Lives Matter,  like Extinction Rebellion. Some of them are as big as very large corporations and many operate  with very large budgets as well.  The vast majority of global NGOs are Western-based. That's just the reality of it. And that  inevitably leads to certain cultural biases and certain ideologies which are exported around the  world as and when those NGOs go and work in those different countries. This is often done  subconsciously. It may not be the, you know, the primary motive or something that's a priority  for these organisations to go and export ideology, culture and values into other parts of the  world.  But it happens when you have people from Europe, from the US, from the UK working in  different parts of the world, they can't help but bring their cultural biases to bear. So whilst the  ability of these global NGOs to channel not just funding and resources, but also to raise  awareness for these issues globally is really, really important and is of great benefit for the most  part, they can also suffer from the cultural bias that we talked about earlier. They can suffer  from a lack of understanding when it comes to the local context that they are operating in and  therefore maybe making some missteps because of that lack of understanding when it comes to  ideology and political beliefs. There may be mixed motives there, right? Yes, we're here to help  conserve a certain area of forest, or help with the provision of water or housing or education.  But at the same time, maybe we can bring these communities around to our way of seeing  things, to our worldview, to our belief in certain forms of government, or in certain ways of  living when it comes to values and ideals.  
So these are things for international NGOs to be aware of, many of them already are. They put  in a lot of effort to avoid these pitfalls. But it's also really important for people in the countries  where those international NGOs are working to just keep this in mind. And again, it's just that  independent investigation, look behind the scenes, go a little bit deeper. Don't take what you  see purely at face value.  Host:  Karim has highlighted some of the key challenges faced by civil society. Most obviously,  constraints around financial and human resources can limit the activities of CSOs, and force  them to make difficult trade offs.  Their ability to achieve their missions may also be compromised by financial ties to specific  donor agendas, or even the political situation in a country.  Challenges also arise from the members of CSOs. Although it may be easy to assume that all  CSOs are inherently good and purpose-driven, they are still comprised of individuals, making  them prone to unethical behaviour. We’ve seen this with lobbying groups on behalf of  businesses, and in the phenomena of astroturfing in the digital domain.  At the international level, global NGOs, more often than not based in the West, may  inadvertently export cultural biases and ideologies. This, coupled with a lack of understanding  of local contexts can lead to missteps in global NGO initiatives.  It’s important for businesses and governments to understand these challenges in order to better  support civil society, given its crucial role as a pillar of our modern world.  Keen to learn more about civil society? Now that you’ve come to the end of this core module,  you can learn more from other experts in the rest of this series, who share their insights on  working in - or with - CSOs to redesign society for the better.

Navigating Change: From Colonial to Contemporary Africa

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Obiora Ike illustrated the enduring impacts of colonialism and economic exploitation on Africa, highlighting the systemic challenges and persistent stereotypes that continue to affect the continent.Colonialism has left Africa with profound and persistent impacts, particularly in how artificial borders created by colonial powers have led to enduring ethnic conflicts and systemic challenges.Africa’s economic exploitation persists to this day through the extraction of resources, primarily for international benefit, perpetuating a cycle of dependency and inequity for local populations.Negative stereotypes about Africa, rooted in historical injustices, continue to influence global perceptions and policies.Modern multilateral institutions, ostensibly created to promote equality, can actually perpetuate economic and political control over Africa, undermining its sovereignty and development.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Navigating Change: From Colonial to Contemporary Africa  Host:  It is a commonly held belief that the rules - based world order, which arose in the 20th century,  was designed to help balance the global scales of power, creating a level playing field for all  nations.  However, it is being increasingly recognised that this has not been the case for many countries,  particularly those formerly colonised by Western nations.  And nowhere is this disparity more apparent than in Africa.  To help unpack these far - reaching impacts, we’re joined by Professor Obiora Ike. Professor Ike is  a world leader in the field of ethics. He is a Professor of Ethics and Intercultural Studies at the  Godfrey Okoye University in Enugu State, Nigeria, and a Fo unding Director of the Catholic  Institute of Development, Justice, Peace and Caritas.  He’ll share how many of the structural challenges faced by African nations arise from the legacy  of colonialism and contemporary stereotypes.  Professor Obiora Ike:  There has been an intrusion on the African continent, and this intrusion is the reason for the  stereotypes we hear about. You talk about slavery, you talk about colonialism, you talk about  neo - colonialism, you talk about a globalisation that creates a glob e and puts every other person  outside. You can only jump in through the window because the door is closed.  If you come to a country, let me say a country like Nigeria, and you will remove Cameroon,  remove Togo, which are part of Nigeria, and put them away. Remove Benin Republic and create  other republics there. You have divided the people because the boundaries   have been just  arbitrarily made. Then they start living in environments where they have to say, do I know you?  Are with the same tribe? How come that we are together under one country, under one  sovereignty? They have to start now discussing this. So by t hat you have divided their people and  now you stereotype them for fighting within, for what you caused.
  The African peoples must also know that they have a responsibility to themselves. Unfortunately,  when we have to do our local elections and we have to find who will be a President in Ivory Coast,  the French government has to impose an African candidate. Wh en you have to do an election or  find a job for someone on top positions, internationals now try to impose a candidate of their  choice over their own people. So the originality of your own voice is undermined.  Your own people imagine to talk the truth to power and to speak for your own interests and to  protect the integrity of the people, of the African peoples, of the interests of the Africans within  the international community. They do not have a space, so tho se who impose on them become  now the stumbling block and corruption then becomes a way of life.  The other one is economy. Taking the resources, colonise them, made them part of your own  business enterprise and the people have no access. They have to fight for the crumbs. Look at  issues of corruption where Africans have no access to the world trade. I   produce mangoes,  banana, oranges, tea, coffee, but I cannot sell directly into a world market. I must have to go  through second, third, fourth agents. And even   then,   I cannot even qualify for what another part  of the world have defined for all the rest.  Why should it be only the dollar and the yen and the pound and the euro and so on that are  exchangeable? But most of the African currencies have to go through other currencies to be  accepted. Think about French colonial African countries. Their money is ba nked by the central  bank of France. Or if you think about English countries, many of them, like Nigeria, they have to  sell their oil and bank it in the USA.  So how is it that people stereotype you when they have hoodwinked and hijacked your authority?  So the stereotypes are invalid. Allow Africans competition anywhere globally. In sports, they  excel. In games, they excel. In dance, they excel. In music, they excel. In arts, they excel. But once  you know, you say in banking, you don't give them a chance.  We must be allowed, and that's also part of the discussions moving into the 21st century to  redefine the frames of reference.  Host:  Even after gaining independence in the post - colonial period, many African   countries suffer   from  systematic marginalisation and exploitation to this day.
  And as Professor. Obiora has shared, there are many forms through which this oppression  persists, often through the modern institutions of trade and finance, ostensibly designed to  champion equality.  An example is how the CFA franc currency has been historically imposed on the 14 Francophone  African countries. In short, the CFA franc is pegged to the Euro and requires these nations to  deposit 50% of their foreign reserves with the French Treasury. Whil e this arrangement has  brought economic stability and growth, critics argue it perpetuates French domination and  hinders true economic autonomy.  Another example is the International Criminal Court, or ICC, which to date, has indicted 44  individuals, 39 of whom are African leaders. While the ICC's actions have brought some measure  of justice, critics contend that the court disproportionately targets   Africa, neglecting equally  grave atrocities in other regions.  These systems, under the guise of progress and fairness, perpetuate a cycle of dependency and  disadvantage,   hindering   Africa's   potential   to   achieve   true   sovereignty   and   sustainable  development.

Inspiring Sustainable Transformation 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Christine shared insights on navigating the complexities of proposing and socialising new ideas and policies, whether in the public or private sector.The Four Ts Framework: To affect change, one should focus on Target, Timeline, Transparency, and working Together.Individuals in a company can identify areas for improvement. They should strategise on how to socialise these ideas within their department and plan to communicate them up the chain of command, considering potential resistance and leveraging professional associations.Effective change, particularly in complex issues like decarbonisation, requires collaboration across sectors. Businesses understand the need for a level playing field in terms of costs and regulations, and joint efforts can lead to quicker, more effective solutions.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Inspiring Sustainable Transformation  Rohan Hazell :  Making decisions that centre societal and environmental development   -   as opposed to just  focusing on economic growth   -   can be a challenge.  How can you inspire change in your organisation?  To answer this question, you’ll hear from Professor Christine Loh, Chief Development  Strategist at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for the Environment.  Professor Christine Loh:  If you are not yet the boss, but you want to do something in a company, it's useful to identify  what it is. And generally, I think people working in an organisation, they have some idea.  Usually that idea could be coming from their area of work. So, for ex ample, people might say,  well, you know, I'm an engineer working for, let's say a contractor or a property company. I  know that if we did certain things differently, we   could   save energy.  So, people in that sort of situation can actually think about how they're going to take that  idea, socialise it within the company, or socialise it within let's say at least their unit and their  department, and then plan on how they would take it up the ch ain of command. They do  need to think about who they're going to go and explain it to, right?  So set new priorities, identify the vested interest in the company who might not want to do  anything. How can you persuade them, and how can you lobby or how can you join forces  with your colleagues in other companies in the same business? You know, it is   possible for  them even because many of them are members of professional associations, perhaps to use  the professional associations as a springboard for putting forward new ideas.  The four Ts was something we developed when I was in government. It kind of makes sense  to people, right?  You know, if you want to change, you need to have a target and a timeline, and you need  transparency. So, as you are trying to do something, surely you want to be able to track how
  you are   doing,   and you want to share the results. So, there is transparency. And actually, when  you're doing something difficult or something new, it's really important to do it together.  So, let's take the issue of achieving net zero. So, this means we have to do many different  things to decarbonise when actually 80% of the world's energy still comes from fossil fuel.  This means the problem is very big. This means we all need to go on a re volution in order to  make changes within a short time, because if we want to get to 1.5 degrees sooner rather  than later, we have to act at scale and at speed.  So, nobody really knows how to do that because the world is powered by fossil fuels. When  you're not quite sure what it really takes to do all of this, it's best to collaborate, it's best to  do it together. So, communities of government, society, and indus try can actually come  together and identify those things that they actually agree on.  They need to agree on what are some of the steps that together they can take. And the good  thing about business is they do understand that if cost is going to be increased to do  something, that it should be a level playing field. That means everybody has t o abide by the  same new laws and regulations.  So, if people can talk through this, they will come up with ideas of actually how to do it quicker  and faster and better. I really, really believe in that because throughout my career I have  witnessed that when people come together to try and talk through   problems and solutions,  usually you come up with something better.  In my school and subsequent working career, I have always found that people generally want  to do a better job. People generally want to change things for the better, but it's how to do  it. And I find that my own experience in the public sector has given me   clues and tools about  how to prioritise, you know, what solutions are, how to socialise, how to bring people  together, and how to go step by step in finding solutions that can persuade people to make  changes.  It'll be very good for anyone to have some 101 in understanding the mechanism for proposing  any kind of changes and how to socialise them in order to change minds, to bring people  together, to collaborate and cooperate, so that we can actually realize that   higher good, that  next step that we want to see because we know it's better.  So, I think basically what I'm saying is have some 101 in understanding how to pursue change.  Whether you are in the public or the private sectors because the tools are the same. Mm.  Now, once you go from the private sector to the public sector, right, you   know you want to  deal with society and you want to change and lobby for change, then, then you kind of  upgrade your, your, your basic 101 into understanding how public affairs work. And then, you  know, you'll be able to navigate government and the pub, yo u know, and the public sector  much better.
  Rohan Hazell:  Complex   decision - making   requires   bringing   people   together   through   constructive  stakeholder engagement, and a critical examination of available data and evidence.  Taking a systematic and systems - based approach to generating solutions ensures that  outcomes are rooted in reality, factor in diverse viewpoints and interests, and facilitate  meaningful and sustainable change.

Negotiations and Trade-offs in Multilateral Decision-Making

### keyTakeaway
Sharan Burrow argued that multilateral institutions need reform for their decision-making to move beyond prioritising the self-interests of certain nations, to a legislative foundation prioritising people and the planet.A new development model is needed that respects national sovereignty, democratic rights, and cooperative approaches to address global challenges like climate change and shared prosperity.For meaningful change, transparency in business and government actions is crucial, coupled with a compliance model that promotes development and implements effective grievance and remedy mechanisms.A layered approach to funding social protection systems is necessary, involving government commitments, increased official development assistance allocations, and strategic use of multilateral funds.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Negotiations and Trade - offs in  Multilateral Decision - making  Rohan Hazell :  Decision - making in multilateral institutions is often opaque, yet it has the potential to impact  entire nations, especially when it comes to decisions on development.  This is why Sharan Burrow, former General Secretary of the International Trade Union  Confederation, calls for a rethink of decision - making in multilateral bodies.  She proposes that the legislative foundation should better respect national sovereignty,  democratic rights, and cooperative approaches to addressing global challenges like climate  change and creating shared prosperity.  Sharan Burrow:  Let me say upfront, I   am   a committed advocate for multilateralism, but not the model that  we now have. It has simply run its course. It's been corrupted by the self - interest of richer  nations, of dominant corporations, of vested individuals. The Bretton Woods institutions, and  I   have great respect for one of the great women of our time leading the IMF, for example, in  [Kristalina] Georgieva, but she alone can't drive the change that we want. If you listen to her,  she, like the UN Secretary General, has a very different sense of wh at the world needs than  the actual deliverables.  If you go to the WTO, again, another woman I respect and   like   Kristalina would   be   see n   as a  friend, Ngozi [Okonjo - Iweala], fantastic, amazing woman, but the WTO is failing everybody  because again, you can't find the level of agreement that you are talking about. The  constraints that kept developing countries from building their own industri al models while  engaging in global trade has played out as a disaster.  And we saw the absolute limitations of that inflexibility with Covid 19, when supply chains  basically closed overnight, when economies and some supply chains pretty much collapsed.  So, we need to again think about what's the development model that is recog nising of  sovereignty of nations, recognising that democratic rights and freedoms are fundamental to  people having a say about their own future, but then how we have to cooperate on the big
  world questions, climate being one of the biggest. Shared prosperity being another, and of  course a global floor of rights. So, in simple terms, if we're going to rebuild multilateralism ,  we must   see reform of the Bretton Woods institutions.  Then what we need to say is, what's the legislative floor? What's the floor that protects  working people, that protects communities against corruption that actually protects the  environment for generations to come? And there are many creative ideas. Like,   people have  all sorts of ideas about how we would genuinely sit and say, how do we share prosperity?  How do we, even on the emissions front, how do we actually build a carbon pricing ,   to the  way we transfer money from those who are taking all of the spoils or the majority of the spoils  and failing to   redistribute them, but doing it now to ensure mitigation and adaptation runs to  the trillions we need, not the scraps of the fight around a hundred billion because that's the  reality.  You need a legislative foundation that puts people and planet at the heart of   demands that  business   and   governments   must   accede   to .   Y ou   need   transparency.   If   there   is   no  transparency, then accountability is just an empty word. And if you're going to have  accountability, you have to have a compliance model that is serious, is inclusive of everybody  and allows for not a punitive approach   in total, although there will be some elements of  sanctions where people simply don't want to follow the rules, but actually allows for a  development approach.  If you take the trend now ,   towards the trend, it should be a race to implement the UN guiding  principles for business and human rights, then legislating in countries in the EU, for example,  around due diligence .   T he other two pillars must play out as well, which of course is grievance  and remedy. And so, we have to set up the mechanisms, whether it's at national, at  corporation, at local level, that allow people to have their grievances heard based on  evidence, ens ure remedy, and in return, think then about how we learn from that to build  prevention into the model.  It   can be done .   I t is being done by good corporations and you   have   got new standards  emerging. You know, the ISSB standard has achieved already a level of compatibility between  that new standard for climate   and the European standard, but it's still   pretty complex. Needs  to be simplified.  But with the leadership of Emanuel Faber, then in   fact, just transition is absolutely declared  as the next step. With the investment commitment through GFANZ, then Mark Carney has  driven a set of transparency demands that includes just transition as an example.  So, we can reshape the economic base of our future, but we have to have everybody at the  table and people have to be able to see it. You know, if somebody comes to you and says,  " you know, I'll make your future really secure if you just do this. ”   If this is not defined and you  don't feel comfortable that you are not actually being conned, well, why would you take a  risk? You know, “trust me” is not going to work anymore.
  And it comes back to our levels of governance at all levels. Democratic governance.   T hat's  why the Common Agenda Summit is so important because governments are elected by the  people. Now they   are   elected to lead. That's true. And we expect them to lead, but we don't  expect them to be authoritarian governments who don't listen to the aspirations and reflect  the aspirations of their people.  And when you look at   developments that I champion,   like the Wellbeing Economy Nations,  where they   have   gone beyond GDP and look at the others that are stuck in a growth model  of simply   driving   GDP at all costs, then we have   an economic conflict in the world that is in  fact   reflective of the despair that people are feeling and the destruction of our environment  that we must address.  So, we can only do it together. It's such a huge set of challenges. I'm an optimist. I think that  it's absolutely possible to get to a point where we can feel a confidence in the future, but it  will take all of us. And no vested interest can do this by the mselves.  So, we actually indeed   have driven this agenda, but I want to pay tribute to Olivier De  Schutter, who as a Special Rapporteur for extreme poverty, and indeed with the leadership  of the French government, with the trade unions, and with business, actually drove this  agenda   to the front of economic policy and social policy globally. It's now there, it's essentially  part of, as I said, the global accelerator on jobs, social protection and just transitions, but it's  also at the heart of the social contract.  You can do this a number of ways. You can have a global fund. That's never been my preferred  model. I think that you have to look at it in layers. Like, your question about,   do you allow  governments to abdicate responsibility?   No, not at all. Governments   with their workers and  their   employers need to actually make decisions about the scope of a comprehensive fund .  T hen if you fill it out and you're have in one column all the things   you want to fund in the best  of a social welfare model, like the one in my country, although it needs a bit of repair here  and there, and the one in Canada or   the UK   or Europe, then you will have things like health,  education,   aged care, childcare,   and   income resilience. So, when people are without income  through disasters or unemployment, they're not   forced to   starve to death .   T hey and their  families have some hope.  If you layer those things and you work out what it costs, it's actually not that much of a  percentage of   the   GDP in any country. It is an initial outlay, but if you can get   some of that  from a fund   for the poorest countries, some of it from commitments that government should  be forced to make themselves about redistribution of taxation dollars   and   some of it   from  ODA .   D o you know, it's a scandal that we spend less than 2% of all the ODA in the world on  social protection, and it's a chicken and an egg argument .   W hen you ask governments why  they don't put more into social protection, they say   the countries don't ask. And when you  ask the countries, they say   the donors wo uld not   give it. You know, you could tear your hair  out around these sorts of impasses.
  In reality, if we lifted that to an initial 7% of ODA, existing ODA, I'd like to see ODA expand,  but even existing ODA, and in the medium term 15%, you could drive the basis of a fund that  made all the difference.  And then there's the World Bank funds. They have   billions of dollars, but they're deployed in  safety nets here and safety nets there. It's not building a system, which   is   the best optimism  around this .   Y ou put a comprehensive system in place, you give it 10 years and you'll have a  sustainable basic economy. Because for every level of investment, then you will ultimately  get a multiplier impact, you know, up to 9% back from that investment.  You build basic economies; you protect your people. It's a foundation of a very different,  decent development model. Why wouldn't we want it?  Rohan Hazell:  Multilateralism must be reformed to protect against the disproportionate influence of richer  nations, dominant corporations, and vested interests. Redesigning the multilateral system  requires a legislative foundation that protects people and the environmen t.  Transparency and compliance models that are rooted in a just transition framework and  informed by the principles of a wellbeing economy are crucial to driving this transformation.  To this end, collaboration between nations that includes governments, businesses, and  workers is also needed for a meaningful redesign of global economic systems to support  planetary and societal wellbeing.

Managing Pandemics: Social Protections

### keyTakeaway
This chapter discussed how adaptation strategies, such as lockdowns and social distancing, need to improve to provide appropriate protections for different segments of society. Social protections are vital for all workers, particularly those in essential services as they are more vulnerable to infection.Adaptive and inclusive strategies are critical for maintaining continuity in essential services, such as education, ensuring no one is left behind due to technological or socioeconomic barriers.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  M anaging Pandemics: Social   Protections  Rohan Hazell:  We all remember the restrictions put in place over the   COVID - 19 pandemic period . F rom  wearing face masks to social distancing, and the world's first ever international quarantine.  These were all adaptation strategies to living with the contagion, and they fundamentally  changed the way we lived for two years in some cases.  Each country practiced these social protection measures to a different degree, and different  communities responded positively and negatively to having their individual freedoms  curtailed. People in the US appeared in global media for instances where they c hose not to  adhere to government mandated lockdown measures ,   while people in Vietnam also made  headlines but for responding with acceptance to their government's lockdown policies.  However,   social protections were not applied uniformly, even in societies that responded well  to lockdowns. The pandemic introduced the term essential worker or frontline worker to  most of us, and these were the members of society that could not simply work from ho me  because they were needed to keep our economies running. People like store clerks, truck  drivers, sanitation workers, farmers, and of course doctors and nurses.  While white collar workers had the opportunity to stay safe at home in the early days of the  pandemic, essential workers did not have such an option. In some cases, essential workers  did not receive the treatment nor compensation they deserved, despite the   fact that they  were essential to the adaptation strategies.  Migrant workers are an example of this. Even in Singapore, a country renowned for its high  standards, essential migrant workers living in dorms were not provided with adequate  housing to prevent the virus from rapidly spreading through their ranks ,   leading to high  hospitalisation rates. In other cases, essential migrant workers were fired to save cost, but  had no means of returning to their home countries due to travel bans.  This tells us that adaptation strategies must be better tailored to ensure these segments of  society receive the same social protections as others. Marginalising already marginalised  communities during an epidemic or pandemic not only increases the risks t hey face, it also  allows for diseases to mutate and become even more infectious or deadly.  When talking about social protection, it's not just frontline workers that need to be  considered. In the event of another pandemic, we must have adaptation strategies that
  ensure education can still be provided for youth. We saw how online learning became the  standard mode of delivering education in many countries, but this is obviously a challenge in  low - income countries where domestic access to technologies for remote lear ning can be  limited.  According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, around 706 million students lack internet  access and 56 million live in areas not covered by mobile networks. So, how can education  adapt in the instance of a pandemic?  Well, for starters, a combination of in - person and at - home learning can be used in areas  where it is safe to do so. Schools can divide students into smaller groups and have them  attend school on different days to reduce the risk of transmission. In countri es where internet  access is an issue, education institutions can partner with TV or radio organisations to  broadcast education this way. In fact, during the pandemic, 70% of African countries  implemented this kind of distance education, leveraging on teach ers from public and private  schools, university departments, and the Ministry of Education.  For example, Radio Okapi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo launched Okapi Accord or  Okapi School, which is a twice - a - day learning program for primary, secondary, and vocational  school students. In Rwanda, the Rwanda Broadcasting Agency produced and a ired nationwide  basic literacy and numeracy classes with the help of UNICEF. The same was also true for  Malawi. These efforts are supported by the provision of learning materials including  textbooks, worksheets, and assignments, which can be completed at h ome.  Lastly, community - based peer - to - peer learning between students of different age groups is  an adaptation strategy we saw more commonly in low - income countries, and it's something  that high - income countries can learn from. Older students or community members   with more  education were organised to help younger students learn by providing mentorship and  guidance, especially as parents still had to work.  Adaptation strategies to epidemics and pandemics require shifts to the nature of social  protection. If we are to learn from   COVID - 19, then future strategies will need to be more  inclusive of essential workers, marginalised communities, and youth.

Local Solutions: Africa & South America

### keyTakeaway
We learned how mitigation and adaptation strategies have been implemented in Africa and South America while being tailored to suit local contexts.Environmental assets can be monetised in a manner that does not damage the environment while also earning revenue for the purpose of conserving these assets.The effective protection of wildlife and natural resources requires collaboration between modern state forces and indigenous communities to foster a balance between conservation goals and the needs of local communities.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Local Solutions: Africa and South America  Elaine Fernandez:  For many low-income nations, the task of development, let alone sustainable development, has  proven to be an extreme challenge when compared to high-income counterparts. What works  for rich countries simply isn’t replicable by other parts of the world. Nevertheless, there are  success stories we can learn from.  Now let’s hear from Erik Solheim, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment  Program, on how countries in Africa and South America were able to approach mitigation and  adaptation, despite these limitations.  Erik Solheim:  Africa has unfortunately some disadvantages. Look, the population of Africa now is roughly the  same as the population of either India or China. But India, China are one market. Africa has 54  markets, some of them are very, very small. If you produce something inside the Indian state of  Tamil Nadu in the southeast, you can sell it in Jammu Kashmir in the northwest, and it's the  same nation. And there are no customs to be paid or any difficulties with that, while selling  even between small African nations is very difficult. So, I think it's absolutely critical for Africa to  create one market. Otherwise, divided, Africa will unfortunately be very weak. Today, Africa is  maybe 1% of the global trade, a much higher percentage of the global population. That needs to  change.  However, within Africa, there’s 54 nations, not all of them are successful. Some are much more  successful than the others. Let me point to one successful nation, in my view, that's Rwanda. A  small landlocked nation, been through the worst genocide in human history in 1994. It was  absolutely horrendous. But out of that genocide came a strong, yes, somewhat authoritarian  government, but a very development-oriented government. And that put Rwanda on rapid  economic growth and had done it with a lot of great green policies.  One of them is to protect the gorillas. There are a number of gorillas in Rwanda that's an  endangered species. One of the species closest to humans, of course, we should protect it. And  they have done it fantastically. The number of gorillas is now coming up by the day. Why is that?  They've created a brilliant economy in protecting the gorillas.  
If you want to see the gorillas, you have to pay a high price. The cost is now $1,500 for one  person for one hour to see the gorillas. So, yes, it's a kind of tourism for the rich, true, but it  creates a fantastic economy for the people in the area there for the bus drivers, the hotel staff,  the tourist guides, all of those. So, of course, with that economy, they became the first line  protectors of the gorillas. If you harm the gorillas, well, you harm the future of the people living  there. So, they protect the gorillas. And that showcases how turning environmental assets into a  good economy protects the assets better. So, turning the beauty of the land into a tourist  economy, which benefits the local people.  You must make people who live in the area of the wildlife the beneficiaries of the protection.  Otherwise, it'll fail. I mean, if the people are guiding the poachers, there is no way a state can  protect elephants. If the local people are guiding the poachers. The local people see the  benefits of keeping the elephants. It's very hard to destroy them. And that's why the success  story of Rwanda is so important.  It's exactly the same in Brazil where President Lula at the peak of his power, and I'm sure he'll  repeat it now, made the local tribes of indigenous people, the frontline protectors of the wildlife  and the forest because they're out there, they're in the forest to see what's happening. And if  they can work with the police and the army to protect it, it's very strong protection. And by the  way, this is not very different from the most developed nations in the world. When I was  Minister of Environment in Norway, I opened eight national parks during my time as the  minister. And if I had a long dialogue with the local people there, there would be a much  stronger protection of the area because if the local people saw the benefit, they became the  frontline   protectors.   But   then   you   also   need   to   make   some   compromises   and   some  amendments to satisfy the local people.  I mean, Lula was the President of Brazil for eight years and he set, put in place policies, which  were followed by his successors which I think were brilliant. There are 20 million people living in  the Brazilian Amazon. They all want a living, they want to support their children or their  families, so that they need jobs. So, what he did was to make sure that all the indigenous people  there were frontline protectors. But the indigenous people cannot protect the forest against the  police and against the army, because the army and the police at the end of the day are much  stronger forces than relatively small groups of indigenous people. But when indigenous people  can work with the police and the army, they become very strong because the indigenous people  are out there in the forest seeing whatever is happening.  If someone is coming there to dig for gold or destroy nature, they would know it, and they can  notify the police and the army, which can take action. So, this integrating the forces of the  modern state with the historical knowledge of indigenous people, became very strong. And I'm  very sure that Lula will repeat this when he's now back as the President of Brazil.  
Elaine Fernandez:  In highlighting examples from Africa and South America, Mr Solheim points to two key features  of successful mitigation and adaptation strategies for environmental issues.  First, overcoming economic barriers to development and progress. In Africa, this can involve  improving the ease of trade between nations.  Second, the importance of involving local communities as stewards of the environment. After  all, the environment you see and experience every day is the one you care about the most, and  getting community support is one of the most proven ways to enact sustainable development  from the bottom up.

How Do I Relate to the Trends Shaping the World?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you were introduced to the core concept of Redesigning Society, which is a model to help governments, businesses, and individuals alike navigate the complexities of the 21st century.Environmental issues are converging with global conflicts, economic challenges, and a decline in social wellbeing, signalling the need for a new approach to shaping our societal and economic systems.Redesigning Society is a comprehensive framework for enhancing planetary and societal wellbeing, requiring a critical understanding of the mega drivers of change and collaboration among the four pillars of modern society to address existential threats through systemic transformation.Whether you work in business, government, civil society organisations, or are still a student, you play a crucial role, within your own capacity, in creating solutions to global challenges that build a more resilient and equitable world.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  How do I Relate to the Trends Shaping the World?  Elaine Fernandez :  The summer of 2023 saw the   hottest average global temperatures in the last 125, 000 years.  Armed conflicts are taking place across the world. The global economy is still reeling from the  impacts of the first global pandemic since 1918. To add to this, experts are warning against  the   threat posed by our most advanced technological creation   –   AI or Artificial Intelligence.  It's no coincidence that these existential threats are converging, and if we honestly confront  the driving factors behind them, much becomes obvious. These threats are a direct result of  a global economic model that has been out of sync with the environmen t and society for  decades. From underpricing resources to pursuing growth reliant on overconsumption,  clearly many of our economic activities are ill - suited to solving the collective challenges of our  times.  Charting a course through the complexities of the 21st century demands a framework for  transformation. What should this look like?  At GIFT.ed, we call the transformation of our economic, governance and societal systems for  a more resilient and equitable world   "Redesigning Society".  There are five main components to achieving this goal. First, are the four pillars of modern  society: government, business, media, and civil society. Understanding the roles they play and  how the four pillars relate to and collaborate with each other is a   critical first step. Second,  are the six mega drivers of change shaping the world in the 21st century: population growth,  resource constraints, the crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, the shifting world order,  and climate change. Third, are ten exi stential threats facing humanity, all of which are  impacted by the drivers of change, and which can be categorised as either societal shortfalls  or environmental crises.  We'll explain more on these in the next module. For now, all you need to know is that they  have serious implications for the pillars of society.  So what can we do about these problems? Fundamentally, we need to transform our  economic, governance, and societal systems to enhance planetary and societal well being.  This is the fourth component of redesigning society.
  But how exactly do we get there? This is captured by the fifth and final component. Insured  Resilience captures the core building blocks for systemic transformation and includes public  policy, business model innovation, social organisation, and unleashing   the potential of  individuals and organisations. This brings us back to the pillars of society, which have a stake  in growing their level of Insured Resilience by collaborating and innovating to protect against  existential threats.  Over the coming modules, we'll dive into the details of each of these components and provide  you with a roadmap for navigating the complexities of the 21st century. At this point, you may  be thinking: "Redesigning Society" sounds great, but given the scale   and urgency of the  challenges, these problems are for governments and CEOs to solve. So how does this relate  to me?  Here's how.  At the international level, macro trends like shifting power dynamics and climate change  impact how governments and multilateral organisations like the UN approach policy making.  These policies, in turn, create the conditions and markets in which business   operates,  influencing the strategies they employ. Now this is where you come in. As someone working  for a business, government, or civil society organisation, or even as a student in higher  education, understanding the drivers of change in the world, and r elating these changes back  to your life and work.  It's vital for identifying new opportunities, mitigating risks, and creating solutions to the  collective challenges we face. Your GIFT. e d learning journey will equip you with insights and  practical tools for affecting positive change in your organisation and communities. Our expert  mentors at the frontlines of change will help you cultivate the critical thinking and global  awareness to mov e beyond the status quo.  You'll also find inspiration to help you ignite or reignite your sense of purpose by translating  your ideas to action. Ultimately, your journey with GIFT.ed will help you unleash your  potential and contribute to the global effort to ensure a more resilient   and equitable world.  To start you on this journey, the next chapter will introduce the second component of the  redesigning society framework: the drivers of change shaping the 21st century.

Climate Change

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the final mega trend shaping the 21st century: climate change. Climate change has far-reaching impacts on society, the economy, and the environment, and presents opportunities for governments and businesses to improve how they operate.The impact of climate change is an uncertainty due to the complexity of the climate system and its interactions with various factors, including atmospheric gases, land masses, oceans, and the biosphere.However, it's not a question of whether climate change will occur but how rapidly, to what extent, and the magnitude of human influence involved.Thus, mitigating human-induced climate change is essential to avoid severe social harm, economic failure, and ecosystem collapse.Climate change has knock-on impacts. For example, rising temperatures, acidification of oceans, and shifting weather patterns alter agricultural productivity, which affects nutrition, employment, and social nets.To effectively manage climate change and its impacts, cultivating strategic global awareness as members of organisations is essential, as understanding the interconnected nature of various drivers of change will inform the actions you can take toward achieving a much-needed societal redesign.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Climate Change  Elaine Fernandez :  So far, we've explored five of the six drivers of change, the   social and environmental  certainties of population growth and resource constraints, and the three social uncertainties  of the crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, and the shifting world order. That leaves us  with one final mega - trend to explore: cli mate change.  The world's leading scientific organisations have made evidence based predictions that don't  bode well for the future of humanity. What makes climate change an uncertainty is due to  the sheer complexity of the climate system and how it interacts with other   variables like  atmospheric gases, land masses, the oceans, and the biosphere at large.  Importantly, this isn't a question of whether the climate will change or not: climate change  is a natural and ongoing process. The important question is, how quickly and what magnitude  and to what extent are we influencing it?  Grappling with these questions and mitigating the most destructive impacts of rapid, human -  induced climate change is vital for the global effort to redesign society. Only by confronting  this challenge head - on can we prevent widespread social harm, economic   failure, and even  ecosystem collapse.  Chandran Nair:  We all know, at least most of us know, that the rise in greenhouse gases and carbon emissions  have essentially started to warm the earth. The source of these emissions are essentially our  reliance, almost addiction, to fossil fuels. This is not to say that   we should be demonising fossil  fuels, but we will need to find different approaches to meeting the energy needs of a world  with about 10 billion people.  But the point to remember is that the rise in carbon emissions is now the highest at any time  in about 800, 000 years. The Industrial Revolution and the era of modernity that we all enjoy,  but which have created many of the challenges that we face. In term s of the amount of  emissions that human activity is putting into the atmosphere, the science is very clear that if  we are to essentially live within the limits of a climate - changed world, the global societies  around the world will have to limit the increas e in temperatures to 1.5.
  But the current trajectories of the way we use fossil fuels and the amount of emissions suggest  that we will use up that budget in the space of about less than 10 years, about 9. 5 years. This  is extremely serious. This, again, amplifies why the 21st centu ry will be very different. And if  you speak to some scientists, they will tell you that the idea that we can limit temperature  rise across the world to an average of up to 1.5 degrees is no longer possible. And that we are  likely to see temperatures across   the world increase way beyond 1.5 to about 2 and even 2.5  degrees. So this poses a challenge that no other societies before us had to confront at a time  when we, all our lives, have become so dependent on cheaper, readily available fossil fuels.  Our lifes tyles, the way we live, the way our economies are organised, result in these emissions.  We shouldn't feel personally guilty, but we are culpable. We will have to do things about it,  about how we organise our societies, the nature of the institutions of the state. And rules and  regulations that require us to limit the amount of emissions that   we all individually contribute  and how industries also are a major player in the need to mitigate and reduce emissions. Here  are a couple of examples.  So rising temperatures will lead to acidification of the oceans. Many of us are probably aware  that the rising acidification of the oceans is resulting in major impacts on corals around the  world. Fisheries will also be impacted as acidification and temper ature changes modify the  way in which fish migrate, where they are to be found.  And these in turn have an impact on the communities, particularly the coastal communities  that depend on fisheries for their protein intake. At the same time, climate change will result  in the destruction of sensitive ecosystems. And these ecosystems inclu de the insects that are  essentially part and parcel of the ecosystems and therefore in turn then have an impact on  crops and agriculture.  Our agricultural systems depend on that interrelationship with butterflies, birds, bees, et  cetera. As climate change begins to have a greater impact, this will change the way that we  find these very important ecosystems being altered and therefore have an   impact on our food  systems as well.  Climate change will have a significant impact on established ways of doing things with regard  to agriculture and farming. We have to be very clear that in many parts of the world,  particularly the poorer parts of the world, the millions of farmers who rely   on rain - fed  agriculture for subsistence will have their lives affected in profound ways.  And these are issues that governments will have to attend to on a large scale. So changing  weather patterns will affect agricultural productivity. This will have an effect on nutrition. This  will have an effect on social nets. This will have an effect also   on how governments need to  invest in rural agriculture and the mitigation strategies to protect people.
  The predictions are that some parts of central India will be so hot that it might be impossible  to work during the daytime. That in turn, of course, means, economic productivity is affected.  But coming back to food, it also changes everything that those af fected areas will have to  cope with with regard to feeding people, and employment.  Flood surges will affect agricultural areas. Many parts of the world are now already being  affected –   the Philippines, parts of Bangladesh, etc. –   where agricultural productivity is now  being affected, and even in North America, by seawater surges into areas   that, for centuries,  did not experience these sorts of surges.  As soon as you get these surges, you essentially affect. The soil agricultural productivity is lost  not for one season. It could be for decades and therefore soil salinity decreases farm yields  and thus affects food production and can have global impacts.  Elaine Fernandez:  Climate change is undoubtedly one of the most attention - grabbing mega trends of the 21st  century. From rising sea levels to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, at this  point there are few of us, if any, who haven’t experienced its impacts f irst - hand. If we are to  successfully manage these impacts and minimise the damage they can cause, we must think  about climate change in relation to the other drivers of change. It doesn’t exist in isolation.  Only by cultivating strategic global awareness, and understanding the interconnected nature  of the drivers of change can we create the pathways and tools for achieving a much - needed  redesign.  The next step on your journey is to dive even deeper into the challenges we face and paint a  detailed picture of the complex world we live in. This will help you to join the global search  for solutions and play an active role in redesigning society for the   better.  That’s why in the next module we’ll explore the 10 existential threats that make up a core  component of the redesigning society framework.

Externalities of Consumption

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the externalities, both positive and negative, that arise as a result of consumption, as well as their respective impacts on society and the planet.The positive externalities of consumption are the spillover benefits that society or the environment experiences when a product or service is consumed. Public education, for example, generates immense long-term value for society, but this is not factored into the cost of providing education.The negative externalities of consumption adversely impact the wellbeing of people and the planet, the consequences of which outweigh the private benefit gained by the use of goods or services. For example, smoking cigarettes in public can cause lung disease for others, leading to strain on public health systems that cost taxpayer money.Government intervention - like cigarette taxation or prohibition to compensate or prevent the social costs of smoking, for example - can be an effective tool in addressing negative externalities of consumption

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Externalities of Consumption  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities don’t just occur during the production of goods and services. They also result from  everyday consumption, even with common devices like the smartphone.  These externalities of consumption are what we’ll look at in this chapter.  Rohan Hazell:  Positive externalities of consumption are benefits that society or the environment receives  when a buyer consumes a product or service.  Insurance is a good example of a positive externality of consumption. If you meet with a car  accident and the other driver carries insurance, you benefit from their cover despite not having  paid the premium yourself.  Public   goods   –   services usually administered by governments and made available to all  members of society – also tend to have positive externalities. Take education for example.  Members of society consume education and as a result, learn new skills and knowledge which  improves their ability to contribute to the economy and society. The simple act of learning to  read and write is a net positive to society because this skill allows us to communicate more  effectively with each other.  Vaccines are another product with positive externalities of consumption as our immunity to  contracting a contagious disease passes on a benefit to others in society by decreasing the  likelihood of that disease spreading.  Positive externalities are something that can be shared and even advertised by businesses, as  when people know that consuming a product benefits others, they may feel more motivated to  purchase it.  
With a global economic model built on relentless consumption, negative externalities of  consumption adversely impact the wellbeing of people and the planet. They occur when the  consumption of a good or service harms a third party, and these consequences outweigh the  private benefit gained by using these goods or services.  The typical example is smoking. Smoking is one of the main causes of lung cancer, which leads  to burdens on national healthcare systems. Equally, the effects of second-hand smoke are  widely known. They range from annoyance and discomfort to more serious consequences like  respiratory disease and cancer.  Smoking is also a good example of how governments can act to minimise negative externalities.  In some countries, cigarettes are heavily taxed to compensate for the social costs, in others  there are total bans on smoking in public places and even among certain age groups.  A lesser known but potentially much more harmful example is the antimicrobial resistance that  results from consuming plants and animals that had antibiotics applied to them. In fact, 80% of  all antibiotics are given to livestock to speed growth and prevent diseases, and over 50% of all  antibiotics given to humans are prescribed unnecessarily or used inappropriately.  Society bears the costs of the overuse of antibiotics in food production and healthcare in the  form of ill health and the drug resistant superbugs that have begun to emerge. Nature also  bears a cost not reflected in the price of these drugs through water and soil contaminated with  antibiotic runoff which can speed up the development and spread of resistance.  Another example that may be close to home for many is the ever-expanding culture of  e-commerce and on-demand delivery. At a time when almost any product can be delivered to  your doorstep from any part of the world, excessive plastic waste from packaging that ends up  in landfills, waterways and oceans is both a social and environmental cost which is usually not  factored into the price of the products being sold. The greenhouse emissions from transporting  these goods to our door are another negative externality of consumption as they are not  included in the price we pay for online purchases.  There are very few, if any, products that don’t have externalities associated with them. Take the  ubiquitous smartphone for example.  
From the design and manufacture through to the usage and disposal of these devices, there are  externalities at every step of the way, and almost none of them are factored into the cost of  production or consumption.  From the pollution, or geopolitical impacts and conflict that arises from rare earth mining, to  the working conditions in factories that have repercussions for public health and family  cohesion, smartphone production has a host of negative externalities associated with it.  At the consumption end of the chain, the externalities range from the social costs of distraction  and lost productivity to the mental health effects of constant connectivity.  When it comes to disposal, up to 80% of smartphones can be recycled, but studies suggest less  than 20% of e-waste is recycled globally. While some manufacturers and network operators are  working to make smartphone disposal easier, more efficient and less environmentally harmful,  there is still much more to be done to address what the UN describes as the “tsunami of  e-waste” engulfing our planet.  Elaine Fernandez:  This chapter has discussed the externalities of consumption.  Positive externalities of consumption occur when the use of a product or service benefits  society or the environment beyond the consumer, such as the societal gains from education.  Conversely, negative externalities of consumption arise when the use of goods or services  inflicts harm on third parties, outweighing the private benefits.

Post-Western Economics: From Exploitation to Equity

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter,  GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the manifestations of colonialism’s legacy in our current economic system, and how a post-Western world can shift from an economy of exploitation to equity. Historical colonial exploitation continues to shape modern economic disparities. This legacy is still evident in contemporary economic structures, impacting everything from global supply chains to wealth distribution.While practices such as slavery and outright subjugation have ceased to exist, extractive and exploitative economic models endure via a system of arbitrage that devalues resources in developing nations, leading to the concentration of wealth in their Western counterparts.Redesigning economic models is imperative to break away from their colonial legacy and create systems that prioritise the wellbeing of people and the planet. This involves redefining prosperity within the boundaries set by scientific evidence and reshaping societies accordingly.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Post-Western Economics: From Exploitation to Equity  Rohan Hazell:  The global economic system that underpins the current world order has been undeniably  shaped by the remnants of colonial exploitation, contributing to today's economic disparities.  This historical context is embedded within modern economic practices, affecting everything  from global supply chains to land ownership.  In a multipolar world, understanding history and its complexities, such as colonial legacies, is  crucial to learning from past influences and shaping a better future.  GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair elaborates on how we can move from exploitation to equity in  the post-Western world.  Chandran Nair:  Part of the post-Western world will be a world in which we recognise that the last 200 years,  and even going further, was an economy based on extraction, exploitation and externalisation  of costs. That economic model was framed around the colonial view that the world was the  oyster.  We would go to Africa, we'd go everywhere. We take these resources and develop them. As I've  said, I believe the 21st century is one in which more enlightened minds, most of us, believe that  those days are over. But what we don't quite understand, and which we need to understand, is  embedded within our economic system, is not that blatant extraction through large-scale  slavery and military occupation, but it's still an economic model that is based on underpricing  resources. And where poor countries remain resource-rich countries through which extraction  of resources is taken, and then the value add is created somewhere else, and the economic  cream, the wealth, is concentrated still in the hands of a global elite and a few companies and a  few nations. That needs to change.  So one of the things that most Africans resent is that in the age of technology, so much of the  ingredients that go into digital technology comes from very poor conditions and exploitation of  resources, rare earths, metals, et cetera, in Africa. In other parts of the world, that same  economic model may not be manifested in the way that we see labour being exploited without  any safeguards, proper wages, et cetera, in parts of the Congo, et cetera.  
So in a post-Western world, it'd be incumbent on changing those economic models. This is not  going to be easy. And what we have to understand is there are limits. Now within those limits,  how do we create prosperity for the global majority in the countries that were formerly  colonised, et cetera? Because at the moment, all they know is, and this is the equity issue again  of one economic model where the gatekeepers are still part of the old system and they have to  break away from that and create new systems of self-sufficiency be it in food, natural resource  management, et cetera, but not degrade the quality of the life of their people. Do not degrade  their resources, but at the same time allow them to prosper economically in ways that they will  have to define for themselves, not through the lenses of the past.  And as countries do look at redesigning their society, we also need to take a departure from  looking at the economy purely from the lens of markets and resources, and integrate scientific  knowledge into the limits. If you want to understand how the world operates, if you want to live  in a world in which is more equitable, in a world with 10 billion people, or in countries where  populations are over 100 million, we are going to have to make it very clear that the scientific  evidence is abundant. The science shows us that we are breaching all the limits.  And therefore, when we talk about the way we think about the future in a post-Western world,  the governments in these countries will need to put a lot more emphasis on using scientific data  and meshing that with their economic objectives. For too long, most governments in the  post-colonial era have wanted to emulate the models that were used in the growth targets set  by current institutions of the world, GDP-driven, et cetera. What we have to do is even if we do  not disband our using of those metrics, use science and the scientific data, and building the  institutions to collect that, and to create policies by which we inform our economic decisions,  our decisions about prosperity, and very importantly, to communicate to societies what the  limits are.  When you know what the limits are, then you understand how you redesign your society to live  within the constraints. But the limits are clear, they're scientifically established. And once you  understand the limits, then you redraw your boundaries around what does prosperity look like,  what does equity look like for people and what do you then communicate to people based on  the scientific knowledge, rather than simply talking about things that are not rooted in science,  and talk about things like growth, GDP measurements and so called metrics.  Those should be subsets of the major way of managing your economy, which is to be able to  explain where the scientific boundaries are, what we can do and how do we design our  societies?  Rohan Hazell:  
Beyond acknowledging a past shaped by colonial economic practices of exploitation and  extraction, it is critical that we work toward creating equitable economies by reevaluating  wealth distribution, resource utilisation, and recognising the environmental limits of our planet.  By integrating scientific knowledge into economic policies, we can foster self-sufficiency and  sustainable development across nations, moving away from GDP-centric models towards a  future where prosperity is defined by wellbeing and equitable resource sharing, to build a just  and resilient global society.

How Imperialism Has Shaped Global Economic Development

### keyTakeaway
Professor Korten discussed the historical context and current ramifications of global inequality, critiquing the centralisation of power and wealth resulting from Western colonisation of large parts of the world.The entrenched global inequality stems from a 500-year history of imperial civilisation, where institutions and cultural values were shaped to centralise power and control, leading to competition for resources.International development strategies often prioritise the interests of foreign corporations over local needs, resulting in the exploitation of labour and resources in poor countries and contributing to global inequality.These development patterns have not only exploited developing countries but have also adversely affected the quality of life in high-income countries like the United States.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  How Imperialism Has Shaped Global Economic Development  Rohan Hazell:  Imperialism has had a profound impact on the world’s economic landscape, shaping our  dominant institutions, cultural values, and economic strategies.  Former Harvard Business School Professor David Korten explores this further, helping you to gain  a deeper understanding of the relationship between imperialism and centralised power and  wealth, leading to a society where competition for resources and influ ence prevails.  Prof. David Korten:  Now, if you ask about the causes of this, at least by my take on it, it relates back to the historical  domination of an imperial era, sometimes called imperial civilisation, which of course, has been  generally Western - led and Western - dominated. And during   the years of imperial rule, we have  developed our dominant institutions, all designed to centralise power and control over those  down below. This has led us to developing the cultural values that support these institutions. And  this is today at the institu tions of media and education, actually support cultural values and  stories that celebrate and legitimate institutions, technology, infrastructure, that all ultimately  support the concentration of power and wealth and create societies in which we're all com peting  for power and access.  You know, one of the things I learned during my international development days, when I was  working in the international development establishment, which is part of my work in Southeast  Asia, are global economic strategies promoted by the foreign assistance   community and the  World bank and the IMF. If we had undertaken the development that we should have, which was  to take how people are currently living and find ways to support them in their control of their  agriculture and their health and so forth, we cou ld have selectively introduced beneficial  technologies like immunisation from what we normally call the more advanced or developed  world. Yeah, there were some things that poorer countries could benefit from.  Immunisation, literacy, family planning, things that give people more control of their lives and  resources to meet their own needs. But what we did, in fact, was promote development projects
  that gave foreign corporations and countries more control of the labour and resources of poor  countries, to serve foreign markets through trade controlled by transnational corporations, and  leave the resource rich poor countries with international debt tha t they could repay only by  allowing foreign interests to hold their economies hostage and to control both their labour and  their resources, not to benefit the people of their own countries, but to benefit the rich of the  so - called developed countries.  And what I think is maybe not always recognised in the countries that were exploited by this  process is that those same processes have been destroying the lives of people in the United  States and in many of the other so called developed or high - income coun tries. Now, China has  an incredible record in terms of pretty much eliminating poverty. Of course, one of our issues  that we rarely look at is that the whole way in which we measure poverty is deeply flawed.  One of the things that I became aware of is that in many places around the world, the ordinary  people who were living rural lives as farmers, grew their own food, they built their own housing,  they provided their own medical care. Now, they had a variety o f problems, but basically many  of them lived much better than do the current poor, who have a modest income. With the way  they lived, they had no need for money and they met their needs accordingly.  This is what I come to with this realisation that development would have been very different if  we had approached it in terms of not how do we get these people off the land, which is what  many of the development strategies were doing –   force people off the   land, so that rather than  growing their own food, they had to go off as itinerant agricultural workers, far from their homes  and communities, taking part time jobs, growing other people's food. or, and this was particularly  for the women, they were pushed   off into sweatshop jobs and factory at pittance wages and  miserable lives and long hours, again separated from family and community, producing profits  for transnational corporations.  So I've never seen a deep analysis of exactly what this elimination of poverty in China has meant.  It seems to be a major accomplishment. And my sense is that the government has actually taken  that very seriously and that there has been a reduction in the   deep suffering. But of course, part  of the new suffering is the environmental damage, the pollution of air pollution and water  pollution and so forth.  That's all been a part of that. But it's all part of recognising that we haven't given nearly enough  attention to the question of what is the world that we want together that is consistent with our  nature and needs as living beings, dependent on the health   and vitality of a living Earth, which
  means living within our means, eliminating all the sources of consumption that are totally  wasteful and harmful and contribute nothing to our well being.  And Russia is currently demonstrating that in the most extraordinary way. In Ukraine, which is,  at least to my view, a totally unnecessary and useless war. But such a demonstration of the the  resources we put into creating military weapons, which are for t he only purpose of the  destruction, killing people and destroying the infrastructure and the means of living on which we  depend. One could say that war in our current situation is insane. But the enormous resources,  talent and energy that we put into suppo rting financial speculation, things like cryptocurrencies,  which seem to completely ignore the fact that money is nothing but a number.  You can't eat it, you can't drink it, you can't breathe it, you have bags of it on a desert island, but  they're not going to do you the least amount of good. They're only tokens that we accept in  exchange with one another for things that are of real value.   And the most valuable things are  those things that are essential to our living, our basic needs for food, for basic energy, a place to  live, water, clean air and so forth.  Rohan Hazell:  Because they are rooted in outdated world views and beliefs, many development strategies  promoted by multilateral organisations since World War 2 have led to an even greater  concentration of wealth and power in richer nations whilst marginalising poorer na tions and their  people.  For example, current measurements of poverty fail to include self - sufficiency and non - monetary  means   of   meeting   basic   needs.   Instead,   development   strategies   have   tended   to   push  communities away from rural areas and into urban, low - wage jobs for large corpo rations and  their supply chains.  Clearly, the metrics we use to measure wealth and prosperity must be redefined for a meaningful  economic redesign to take place.

Managing Pandemics: Localisation and Resource Sharing

### keyTakeaway
This chapter highlighted the importance of localising supply chains and enhancing resource sharing to overcome the challenges faced by countries, especially low- and middle-income ones, during pandemics. Strengthening local production of medical supplies and food is crucial for pandemic preparedness, reducing dependency on global supply chains.International cooperation and equitable resource sharing are essential for an effective global response to pandemics, highlighting the need for global solidarity and fairness in the distribution of medical resources.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  M anaging Pandemics: Localisation and Resource Sharing  Rohan Hazell:   One of the major lessons the   COVID - 19 pandemic taught us was that countries  around the world are hugely dependent on international supply chains. This presented a huge  obstacle when medical supplies became scarce because of disrupted global supply chains and  slowdown in production.  For example, at the onset of the   COVID - 19 pandemic, Nigeria had just 169 ventilators to help  sick patients with assisted breathing. Yet Nigeria has a population of 213 million people. This  is because at the time, Nigeria relied on imported ventilators and other medical equipment  and did not ha ve the local capacity to produce its own.  Nigeria was not alone. Many   low -   and middle - income   countries faced the same challenge and  had to import ventilators and other important equipment from high - income countries, often  at great cost.  To prevent this from happening again and to mitigate the risks and impacts of a future  pandemic, countries need to invest in the development of local technologies, materials, and  medicines. This means that the public and private sectors should work togethe r to set up  systems of research and development, innovation, production, and distribution of medical  equipment.  After all, a key element of this is financing. And for high - end products like medical equipment,  governments are able to provide capital as partners. The benefits of this kind of investment  extend well beyond healthcare. Localising the production of essent ial goods rather than  abdicating this responsibility to the international market will create thousands of local jobs  and will spur innovation in the process of creating medical products that are both affordable  and use local materials.  Nor does this just apply to medical products. During the   COVID - 19   pandemic, many countries  faced imminent food crises due to global supply chains being slowed. As a result, many  governments are now investigating how to ensure that their countries can be made as self -  sufficient as possible with food production to mitigate   the impact of disturbed food supply  chains ,   pandemic induced or otherwise.  This is not to say that mitigation efforts to prevent future pandemics should not embrace  globalisation. Quite the opposite. International co o p e ration is an essential ingredient to  mitigate the risks and impacts of a future pandemic. And there are three main reasons as to  why.
  First, collective health risks posed by diseases on national scales are difficult to manage  independently. Second, sharing experience and knowledge accelerates learning and progress.  Information on pathogens, their transmission, the diseases they cause, an d possible  interventions are all areas that public health professionals can benefit from the experience of  others. Third, coming to a consensus on rules and standards will help with the comparability  of information. Also, it establishes good practices and   reinforces mutual understanding and  trust.  We saw International Corporation during the   COVID - 19   pandemic, largely led by the World  Health Organisation. For example, the WHO created the access to   COVID - 19 Tools Accelerator  or ACT Accelerator, which is a global collaboration to enable equitable access to diagnostic  tests, treatments, and vaccines.  Governments and universities also freely offered research and data to help give indicators of  where new strains of Covid might appear or to give countries a head start on creating  treatments and vaccines. But it is important to remember that international   cooperation  during the pandemic also suffered some setbacks.  The WHO was criticised for responding too slowly at the onset of the pandemic ,   and  geopolitical motivations led to the US beginning the process of withdrawing from the WHO.  Equally, the distribution of vaccines became a contentious issue. By October 2021, 133 doses  per 100 people had been given in high - income countries compared with   just 4 doses per 100  people in low - income countries.  The WHO Director General called this a vaccine apartheid, and the unequitable nature of  vaccine delivery across the world was a lesson into how not to conduct adaptation and  mitigation strategies for international crises like pandemics. It is vital that al l countries feel  they are being treated with respect and fairness if cooperation is to work.  In summary, strategies for successful mitigation of pandemics have been changed following  COVID - 19 . Governments around the world now see the need to localise elements of the  supply chain as a means to overcome global trade disruptions, but at the same time, there  are now also more channels for international corporation in the face of unknown diseases.

Biodiversity Loss, Land Degradation, and Extreme Weather

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about three further environmental existential threats, including their causes, impacts, and interconnections. Biodiversity loss has serious implications, with some saying that human activity is resulting in the sixth mass extinction. Biodiversity plays a crucial role in providing ecosystem services, which are essential for human wellbeing, including serving as the basis of the economy. The degradation of soil due to urbanisation, resource extraction, and industrial agriculture is occurring 100 times faster than natural processes can replenish it. With 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil lost annually, 95% of the Earth's land is projected to be degraded by 2050. This poses challenges for food production and the ability to meet the nutritional needs of a growing global population. Extreme weather events caused by climate change are increasing in frequency and intensity. These events have already resulted in significant human and economic costs. Vulnerability to extreme weather varies, but even the wealthiest nations are not immune to its impacts. It disrupts water supply, agriculture, communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. It is important to emphasise that these existential threats are interconnected and are influenced by the global economic system. Individuals and organisations therefore need more awareness and understanding of how our actions impact the environment.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Biodiversity Loss, Land Degradation and Extreme Weather  Rohan Hazell:  In the previous chapter you explored pollution, oceanic crisis, and freshwater crisis. Now we're  going to shift your attention to biodiversity loss, land degradation, and extreme weather.  Biodiversity Loss  There is consensus within the scientific community that human activity has brought about what  is essentially the Sixth Mass Extinction event. According to the WWF, populations of wild  animals have declined by 69 percent since 1970, and today, humans and livestock account for  99 percent of the world's mammals; only 1 percent remain wild and live in their natural  environments.  The question is: Why is this important? Why should we care about biodiversity and ecosystems?  Is it actually important to preserve trees, tigers, insects and fish? Or should our economic  activity and material progress take precedence?  The first step to answering this question is to recognize that plants, animals, and microbes  provide invaluable functions for humans, these are known as "ecosystem services".  Beyond providing the foundation for the economy in terms of raw materials like timber and  food, ecosystems also filter our water, clean our air, and keep our soils healthy. They also have  tremendous cultural value. particularly amongst indigenous populations. In fact, it has been  estimated that 44 trillion economic value generation – over half the world's GDP – is dependent  on nature in some form.  By ruining natural habitats through deforestation or decimating the global populations of apex  predators   like   wolves,   tigers,   and   sharks,   we   risk   upsetting   the   balance of ecosystems,  potentially irreversibly so.  Biodiversity loss also has major impacts on how economies and societies function. Take  healthcare, for example. Most pharmaceuticals start off as natural compounds extracted from  plants and animals before being processed into the medicines we buy or are prescribed. By  
disrupting ecosystems, we risk losing access to these compounds or from discovering new ones  that can be used in medical treatments. To make matters worse, by reducing the diversity of  species and ecosystems – for example, through intense livestock or crop farming – we actually  increase the risk of diseases travelling between humans and animals.  Now why is that? Because pathogens can spread and mutate with greater ease in large  populations of the same species that are packed together. This is partly why 3 out of 4 emerging  infectious diseases, including SARS, Ebola, and COVID 19 have been traced back to animals. If  we want to avoid disastrous outcomes like pandemics or ecosystem collapse, we need to better  value and steward biodiversity around the world– and not just megafauna, like elephants and  dolphins, but also birds, insects, and trees too.  Land Degradation  The effects of our activity on the planet extend beyond water, plants, and animals. It also  extends to the land itself. Soil is something we don't often think about, but healthy soil is the  foundation for the world's forests, jungles, and grasslands, and the resources and habitats they  provide. Yet with urbanisation, resource extraction, and the rise of industrial agriculture, soils  are now being eroded at a rate 100 times faster than natural processes can replenish them. And  with approximately 24 billion tons of fertile soil being lost every year, 95 percent of the land on  earth is projected to be degraded by 2050.  This has serious implications for our ability to produce food that is sufficient in both quantity  and nutrition to meet the needs of a rising global population. If the world is to have a  population of 10 billion by 2050 then to meet their nutritional needs, we'll need to grow 50  percent more food, according to the World Resources Institute.  This simply isn't possible. We don't have enough arable land in the world, and we will degrade  our soils further if we try. This is why soil health is at last coming into focus globally, and why  raising awareness around this challenge is so important. It's also why we need to ask hard  questions. Like, should we really have the right to produce, consume (and inevitably waste) any  food we want at any time of year, in any part of the world.  The answer may not be to grow 50 percent more food, but to simply manage our current food  systems much more effectively. Land degradation is clearly an environmental crisis, but like so  many other environmental challenges, it also raises fundamental questions about the way we  organise our societies and economies. Questions that governments, businesses and private  citizens will have to confront and answer in the coming years.  
Extreme Weather  The final existential threat we need to consider is extreme weather. We've left this one till last  because it is in many ways the most uncertain. While we know that extreme weather is a  function of a changing climate, we don't yet know when or where it will strike or with what  intensity, but that doesn't change the existential nature of this threat. In fact, it makes it more  concerning.  According to the World Meteorological Organization, extreme weather has caused two million  deaths and cost 4.3 trillion dollars over the last 50 years alone. Unsurprisingly, low income  countries and island nations are the most vulnerable to these events, but not even the richest  countries and communities are immune to them.  In March 2023, Cyclone Freddy hit Mozambique and Malawi in one of the longest storms on  record. In the same month, San Francisco recorded its strongest-ever storm. April was marked  by global heatwaves, with record breaking temperatures in Spain and Morocco. May through  July of the same year saw raging wildfires in Canada and, to top it off, the hottest global average  temperature in recorded history.  These occurrences are already having humanitarian impacts. In the long term, extreme weather  can worsen water scarcity, damage agricultural systems, prevent communities from working,  degrade entire ecosystems, damage key infrastructure, and ultimately prevent economies from  functioning, let alone growing sustainably.  Summary  In the first two chapters of this module, we've explored the six environmental crises: pollution,  oceanic crises, fresh waters, scarcity, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and extreme weather.  You   may   have   noticed   that   a   recurring   theme   across   these   existential   threats   is   how  interconnected   they   are.   With   the   globalisation   of   economic   systems   comes   many  opportunities. But these forces also need to be critically examined to better understand how  they are contributing to environmental crises.  This is where you and your organisation come in. As members of your community, country, and  an increasingly interconnected world, it's incumbent on all of us to have the awareness and  understanding to know how our actions impact others– including the environment– and to use  practical tools to effect positive change.  
In the next chapter, we'll move on from environmental crises to the four societal shortfalls  facing humanity.

Public Policy: Challenges in Decision-Making

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Christine Loh described her personal journey from a lawyer and commodities trader to a legislator, with a focus on the importance - and challenges - of evidence-based decision-making in government.Professor Christine Loh’s awareness of her personal knowledge gaps and the complexity of issues faced by legislators reinforced her belief in the importance of evidence-based decision-making rather than opinion-based policies.Faced with the responsibility of voting on a wide range of issues, she developed a method of thorough research and consultation to make informed decisions. This process involved challenging personal opinions and biases to understand the broader context of each issue.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Public Policy: Challenges in Decision - Making  Rohan Hazell :  Have you ever wondered how public policy is created? Should companies wait for regulation  before addressing the potential for negative impact in their business models?  To help answer these questions, you’ll hear from Professor Christine Loh, who is a former  legislator who also served as Undersecretary for the Environment in the Hong Kong  Government.  Professor Loh, who is currently Chief Development Strategist at Hong Kong University of  Science and Technology’s Institute for the Environment, will help you understand and  navigate the decision - making complexity that policymakers and business leaders alik e will  encounter in their efforts to redesign society.  Professor Christine Loh:  My journey has been that of many different things; I've started off as a lawyer, I studied law,  then I went into business. I was a commodities trader for 12 years, and then without really  expecting it, I had a chance to be a legislator in the late part of   Hong Kong as a British colony.  So I was the last appointment in the last phase of British rule before they departed, and before  I started running elections.  Then I got interested in public policy and then after I retired from government, having also  spent time on the executive side of government, I transited to be an academic but I'm not a  real academic in the sense that I haven't really come through an academ ic career, but I do a  lot of teaching and writing at the moment.  I think I'm best known for my work in the environment and in things like climate change,  energy, and biodiversity. And that's because when I was in the government, I was the policy  wonk. I was the undersecretary for the environment.  But in my work, over the course of my public policy and political career, I was actually  interested in how policies are made, how policies are made overall, because as a legislator -   I  actually had to deal with many parts of public policy. We had to vote on   many things. So, I  had to learn really what do you do when you don't know all these areas? What are the
  responsibilities that you have? So, I think if we are looking at just environmental policies that  is one aspect that for me is obviously very important.  But my biggest interest is really how the government makes evidence - based policies, not  based on people's opinions, because one of the most important things I discovered when I  became a legislator was how much I didn't know. And my concern was people made   policies  based on opinion. And we are not really sure whether our opinions are what should drive  policy and if we didn't understand the background to issues, how can we really make good  policies?  So that's my big point. Don't be opinion driven. Make sure you understand where your  opinion came from. And perhaps you need to correct what you think you understood once  you've kind of done the background as to what the issues really are about.  When I was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong legislature in 1992, there really weren't  political parties in Hong Kong. So, you know, there wasn't even a line that I could follow. And  obviously all of us are limited by our own direct area of knowledge.  And what I found sitting in the legislature was that I had to vote on many things ranging from  environment to education, to social welfare, to legal matters and so on.  And I must admit that I felt extremely uncomfortable because in most areas, I was ignorant  of them. But I had a vote. I had to support things, I had to support very specific   things,   and I  had to speak at motions raised by other legislators. So obviously I had to learn very quickly.  And I developed a method where I thought; well, I'm either not going to say anything if I don't  understand it and listen to others, or if I really have to vote, I have to do some really basic 101  homework.  And I had to understand enough myself to be able to make a decision.  And that was when I realized my own leanings. For example, you know let's say about some  kind of welfare issue. Should we approve of some kind of welfare package? Now, I realized  then that I had certain views about certain welfare packages.  But when I asked myself, where, where does my opinion really come   from,   and does it fit with  what was happening in Hong Kong? And what do I really think of the proposal? And will the  proposal actually work in Hong Kong?
  So, I read up on things. I went and talked to people who I thought could provide different  aspects of that problem and then tried to think about it before I would cast my vote.  What surprised me was I had a better understanding of my own biases and prejudices.  Because we hear a lot as we grow up about how the world should be, but most of the time  we have opinions that we don't have to take responsibility for.  It's almost like that, you know, we sit together at a   dinner,   and you know, we just shoot off  and talk about what we like and what we don't like.  But when you have the responsibility to actually support or to refute something that has an  impact on millions of people –   I've really felt extremely uncomfortable.  And as I said, Hong Kong in 1992 did not have political parties where I could vote with the  party. It was my responsibility to understand enough to be able to cast a vote that I felt was  responsible.  Rohan Hazell:  The decisions we make are only ever as good as the data and evidence they are based on. But  even the highest quality information is no substitute for constructive engagement with the  stakeholders who will be affected by our decisions.  As the number and range of stakeholders impacted by a decision increases, gathering  different viewpoints and finding common ground for collaboration becomes increasingly  challenging, especially for governments.  The complexity of decision - making when it comes to public policy reinforces the need for a  deep understanding of the issues, a heightened awareness of local, national, and cross - border  contexts, and a deep appreciation for the ecosystem of stakeholders inv olved.

AI Exposed: Inside the Black Box

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong broke down the 'Black Box' concept in AI, highlighting its implications and benefits, and established a practical foundation for applying AI effectively.A “Black Box”, in the realm of science, computing, and engineering, refers to a system that can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings.Counterintuitively, the opaque nature of AI as a "Black Box" does not hinder its utility but rather enhances it, opening new realms of application.Effective application of AI technologies does not require an exhaustive understanding of their internal mechanics. Instead, what matters most is the data upon which these systems are built.This makes rigorous data assessment a prerequisite for deploying accurate and unbiased AI solutions.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  AI Exposed: Inside the Black Box  Tsubasa Nair:  In the short time they’ve been on the market, large language AI models, like ChatGPT, Gemini  and Llama, have grown exponentially in their uptake and impact across many industries, unlike  any technology before.  This rise to global attention has left many wondering what this technology will mean for us in  our careers, in our organisations, and even the world at large.  Which industries will be hit hardest? Is my career safe? How can companies leverage AI to stay  competitive?  To answer these critical questions, we must first understand some fundamental principles about  AI.  This is where Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed, comes in. Having been involved with AI since 2014,  Dan has been the CEO of an AI business focused on smart home technologies, an advisor to  several AI startups, and has driven and implemented over 30 AI projects at the global transport  company, MTR, at which he was GM of Global Innovation.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Antai School of Business,  where he teaches a course on AI and Product Innovation.  To start, Dan will demystify a classic concept in AI known as the "Black Box" , which refers to a  system that can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its  internal workings.  Dan Wong:  The key to understanding AI is to understand what it means for AI to be a black box. To many  people, it's not really clear what that really means. Understanding this is the first step to unlock  what types of applications are possible, what are not possible and where is the risk. And this  very much relates to the design and structure of AI itself. And AI is designed to mimic the  
physical structures of the human brain. So in the same way that human brains have neurons,  their connections and synapses, the AI version, the machine version, is exactly the same thing.  So this physical structure of AI is built in this way. From one perspective you would say, well, AI  is not a black box because you can actually open it up. And you see the physical machine,  neurons, see the different connections. And by the way, these connections, like the human  brain, have different strengths. And so some connections might be very, very deep and strong,  some are lighter, and these are represented by numbers, right? So maybe this connection is a  strength of five, another one, 0.31. And by the way, these are the parameters that you always  hear when people talk about neural network parameters.  So from this perspective, you can actually see the physical structure. But does that mean we  understand what is the algorithm? And this is where the AI is a black box. Because unlike the  way humans think in terms of logic and steps, when you open up the black box, it's just a series  of numbers. It's not understandable from that perspective.  And so this takes us to one realisation. Ultimately, because of its structure, AI is unknowable.  What's happening in the machine learning world is a machine learning model works, and then  after it works, then we come back and scientists try to figure out how it's working. And you also  then understand why people say even the designers of the black box don't know what's inside.  Does this mean that the black box is not useful? Actually, the opposite is true. Because AI is a  black box is the reason for the power of AI. Previously, before machine learning, there's only  one way of programming a computer. And the concept of computer programming is very, very  simple. It's just a list of steps. All you find out is that there are many, many applications whereby  you can't write the steps.  One example is computer vision. To recognise an object for a human is extremely simple.  Humans have had the benefit of long evolution to do that. If you need to teach a machine this,  then you have to codify this into all sorts of rules. What are the basic rules of identifying a cup  or a car? You try to write down all the rules, but very soon you find that this is a fool's errand.  There are too many exceptions. And so, before machine learning, computer vision accuracy only  reached a certain level very, very low, not usable.  So black box has opened up an entirely new way that humans can work with a machine. We no  longer need to write down all the steps, we don't need to know any logic. All we need to do is  give the machine all sorts of examples, the data. And so in this example of computer vision,  
when we give lots of examples and we show the machine and the example it never saw before,  is it accurate? And we go back and forth and we then kind of determine when it's accurate.  Once it reaches a level that we feel suitable, we finish the training and we can now deploy this  model. But ultimately, we do not know what's happening inside the black box.  What is a black box learning? In terms of the nature of training, many people might think that  machines are trained on things like economics, or logic, or forecasting. It's not that. The basic  training is very simple. The objective of the training is simply to find the right weight for the  connections between neurons. That's all it is, it's a series of numbers. When you deal with a  black box, how do you leverage it? How do you actually use it? And once you know the nature,  right, how do you control a black box? Well, when you're using a black box, all you see is the  input and the output. So that is the crux. Don't need to worry about what is inside the black  box.  If you take a look at the data that was used to train the model, and you trust that data, whether  or not it is data that has no errors or not biassed, then that means if the output is reaching a  certain accuracy level, you can trust the model. That's the best way to really start building that  intuition. To use AI, no need to worry about the algorithm inside the black box.  The key to this is just understanding the data, and the reason for that is the application of AI is  to solve business problems. And so the types of questions that you need to understand are not  necessarily the types of questions that the technology team works on. It's actually taking a step  back and from a business management perspective, asking common sense questions around  whether or not the correlations inside the data will map and bring the output that you expect.  Tsubasa Nair:  You might expect that AI’s opaque nature as a Black Box would limit its usefulness. But as Dan  has shared, the Black Box can actually   enhance   AI’s   utility, unlocking new possibilities for  application  The key is actually to not comprehend every detail of AI's internal workings, but rather to focus  on the data it’s built on.  For most applications, in order to trust the output of an AI model, the primary concern of users  and implementers should simply be the integrity and reliability of the data used to train the  model.

Understanding the Current World Order

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the complex history behind our current Western-led world order and how the rise of emerging non-Western powers is challenging the status quo.The term "World Order" refers to the systems, power structures, and norms that shape global governance and relations among nations. It encompasses the rules and institutions established to maintain stability and address international challenges.The post-World War II era saw the establishment of the “rules-based world order”, largely led by Western powers. This order aimed to bring stability and prosperity to the world after the devastation of war.However, this world order also has its roots in European colonialism,  which has helped enable the West to continue shaping the global political and economic landscape.As non-Western nations, such as China and India, modernise and increase their economic and geopolitical influence, they are increasingly seeking greater representation and a voice in shaping global rules and institutions.The emergence of non-Western powers - and their demands for a more inclusive, balanced, and equitable international system - signal a transition into a new multipolar era, what some term the "post-Western world."

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Understanding the World Current Order  Rohan Hazell:  The phrase “World Order” is mentioned more and more often these days, usually in the context  of US-China relations, the influence of different countries or regions on the world stage, or in  the apparent differences between Western and non-Western ways of governing and managing  global trade.  So, what exactly is world order?  And why are so many political, business and thought leaders either calling for a shift, or insisting  we maintain the status quo? Is the so-called “post-Western world order” something to be  feared or welcomed?  Let’s explore the current and emerging world orders with Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed.  Chandran Nair:  The term “world order” actually comes from the phrase the “global world order” or “the  rules-based world order”. And that's where that term came from. And the rules-based world  order was something that was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. And it is  credited with bringing a great deal of prosperity and peace to the world, despite periods of  regional wars and geopolitics. But it's basically credited the rules-based world order with  bringing great prosperity and peace over a period of 70 years.  The reason we're having this discussion about the world order is that that rules-based world  order is now being questioned by those who believe that they were not part of making the  rules. And if you want to be more precise, that tension arises from the fact that most people see  the world order, the rules-based world order as being essentially a Western rules-based order.  An analogy would be to look at, say, an operating system within a computer or the Internet.  We've had in this space of 20 years, new operating systems constantly being created. Because  
the old systems were seen as inadequate for users and new players. The system became larger,  more complicated. People wanted greater speed. There was a question of equity in terms of  internet access and all of that. So, the rules-based world order is now essentially being  challenged as an operating system that doesn't work for the world anymore. And that is also the  cause of great tension, but also euphoria in some parts of the world.  So when you talk about the world order and you talk about revamping the rules-based world  order, it means different things to different people. It is a political hot potato. If you come from  parts of the world where you feel that that world order essentially created great benefits and  you've argued that it is what has made the world a better place, then you don't want to see it  replaced.  And that's the period that we are going through. 70 years of the old system, which was  reshaping how we thought of the world post the colonial era, post 300 - 400 years of Western  domination, et cetera. And it was meant to be a fairer system. In many ways it was, and it did  some very good things. 70 years on, people feel we need a new rules-based world order.  Without getting into, you know a dissection of what colonialism was about, any student of  history will know that the last 400 - 500 years was based on the Western domination of the  world. The colonisation of Latin America, large parts of Africa and Asia, initially started by the  Portuguese, the Spanish, then the British and other European nations. It culminated in the  largest empire in human history, which was the British Empire.  The dismantling of that grab for power among European nations resulting in the First World  War, cannibalisation among powers, then the Second World War. And that was the most  destructive war in human history. It affected everybody. Millions of people died, and the world  was thrown into turmoil.  That resulted in then a global sort of peace dividend sort of mission to create something  different. And that created today's Western rules-based order.  The Western world was then represented by the victors, which were essentially the UK and the  US. They created the new world order and brought in five other players, created the UN system.  Russia was part of that at that time and so were the other allies of the Germans.  So, that new order resulted in the creation of bodies like the UN, the World Bank for  reconstruction, and then later on bodies like the WTO and many organisations within the UN  
umbrella. And that whole structure created the stability that allowed for 60 - 70 years of overall  good peace. No world wars.  A part of that world order was also the creation of the US dollar as the dominant currency, the  reserve currency of the world, which gave the US great responsibilities, but also allowed certain  powers that depending on the geopolitics and depending on the leadership of the United  States, were exploited in ways that some thought were unfair, particularly the use of sanctions,  trade barriers and things like that.  And so that Westernisation was associated with power and a continuation of the colonial era, in  terms of a group of nations mainly dominated by the West being the sole judges of what was  right and wrong, setting the rules. And as other powers essentially came into play and grew  more powerful economically - these include China, now India, and others such as in Latin  America   -   this   created   tension   and   they   are   arguing   for   a   new   world   order.   Not   a  de-Westernisation in saying that everything that the West did or contributes or its presence  must be replaced by something else. It cannot be a zero sum game. People want a world in  which they have equal say, and it's not dominated by Western powers and particularly by the  United States.  Rohan Hazell:  The systems, power structures, and norms that shape our world are collectively known as the  “world order”.  Since World War II what’s known as the rules-based world order has prevailed, largely led by  powerful Western nations, and the US in particular.  This world order is credited for bringing stability to large parts of the world, but it also has  historical roots in colonialism, and has helped Western nations maintain their dominance in the  modern age.  As non-Western nations modernise and rise in power and influence, they are calling for a world  order that is more responsive to their needs, particularly as many were not involved in the  creation of global rules in the first place. As a result, we are seeing a transition into a new era,  termed the post-Western world.

Moving Beyond 20th Century Economics

### keyTakeaway
Kate Raworth is critical of the outdated economic models still prevalent in contemporary education, arguing that concepts rooted in the 19th and 20th centuries are ill-suited for addressing the challenges of today and the future.The concept of Rational Economic Man, depicting humans as wealth-seeking and self-interested, is a narrow and misleading representation that influences actual human behaviour towards competition and self-interest. The pursuit of endless economic growth is unsustainable and inadequate for addressing the pressing issues faced by already wealthy nations. The fallacies of economics that suggest growth will naturally reduce inequality and pollution have been critiqued by modern data, emphasising the need for economies that are regenerative and distributive by design.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Moving Beyond 20th Century Economics  Rohan Hazell:  What is the relevance of traditional economic theories in our rapidly changing world?  Kate Raworth, an economist from Oxford University, challenges long - held economic paradigms  from the 1850s that remain dominant in today's economic discourse.  She explores why these outdated models are proving disastrous for contemporary societies, and  expresses the need for economic systems that are regenerative and distributive by design.  Kate Raworth:  I believe that the economics being taught today, still in universities, is based on the textbooks of  1950, which in turn are founded on the concepts of 1850. And for the students of today and the  citizens of 2050, this is turning out to be a disaster. Let   me tell you why.  I believe some core concepts still shape what I'm going to call 20th century economics. It's  outdated and it's still being taught. Let's have a whirlwind tour of that old mindset that we need  to leave behind, because whether we've studied economics or not,   it shapes how we hear and  understand the economy, because it's all around us. So the first image that's taught is of supply  and demand. It puts the market at the centre of our vision. It makes price the metric of concern.  And this concept was actually der ived by economists in the 1870s who wanted to make  economics a science as reputable as physics.  Like Isaac Newton had discovered the physical laws of motion. They wanted to create economic  laws of motion. And so they talked about the law of diminishing return, the laws of supply and  demand. They're not laws, these are invented. And they tried to say   that just as gravity pulls an  object to rest, so prices pull markets into equilibrium.  No, they don't. Markets are booming and   busting,   and their complex is ever changing. But they  created this image to give a sense of equilibrium and stability at the centre of this pseudoscience.  We need to move beyond it now.
  What about the portrait of humanity that they place at the centre of their economics?   It's a  character called rational economic man, first created by John Stewart Mill in 1944. He said,  political economy, the name of economics in the day. "Political econo my does not seek to cover  the whole of man's nature, nor the whole of his conduct in society. It sees him as a being who  desires to possess wealth."  You know, I respect John Stewart Mill in many respects, but this was a very unhelpful thing he  did. By saying that economics is only concerned with humanity. As someone who desires to  possess wealth, he created an absolute caricature of human beings, which   has resulted in this  character of rational economic man who sits in the heart of every microeconomic model today.  If I drew a picture of him, he would look like this. He would be a man standing alone with no  dependence. He has money in his hand because he interacts with the world through markets. He  has ego in his heart because he's driven by self - interest. So he has   a calculator in his head, he's  endlessly calculating the prices of everything, and he has nature at his feet, the rest of the living  world as a resource for humanity.  Now, the real problem with this character is that when we are told he is like us, we become more  like him. Students over time say they value self - interest and competition, not altruism and  collaboration. So who we tell ourselves we are shapes who we become . And we need a new  portrait of humanity. The last is the goal. And the goal put at the centre of our vision is endless  growth, no matter how rich a nation already is.  I'm sitting in the UK, one of the richest countries in the history of humanity. And our government,  our politicians and our economists all still deeply assume that the solution to this nation's  problems lies in yet more growth endlessly. These we must leav e behind. Let me add two more.  I spoke about economists wanting to discover the economic laws of motion to prove their  science. And two apparent such laws have been profoundly powerful and influential in  policymaking. The first is around inequality. In the 1940s, brilliant economist Sim on Kuznets put  together data from the United States, Germany and the UK on what happens to inequality in  those countries over time. And he was surprised by what he found. He found that over time, first  inequality increased, but then it decreased. He didn't   expect this. He thought the rich would get  richer, not that the poor would catch up, but he plotted the data. Somebody else drew it like this,  an   upside - down   U   curve. It became known as the Kuznets curve, after him. And it whispers out a  very powerful message. If you care about inequality, don't intervene and try and redistribute
  wealth, because you might slow down growth. And look, growth apparently will even things up  again. Only it doesn't.  In 2014, Thomas Piketty came along. He looked again at the data. He said, actually, Kuznets was  measuring these countries before the wars and after the world wars. And war destroys the  wealth capital of the wealthy and afterwards the government invests in   health, education and  housing. It was war that built this. It was war that turned this curve down. Not the inherent  workings of the market, but the mantra of go through austerity together and tighten our belts  and we'll come out better on the other side, h as had a very, very long tail of influence.  It's trickle - down economics that never trickles down, but keeps trickling up, as we see with the  rise of a global 1% now. In the 1990s, other economists plotted data on local air and water  pollution. And they said, we think we see a pattern, that across co untries, as they get richer, first  pollution increases, but then it decreases. And they tried to explain it with improvements in  technology, and that richer people wouldn't stand for pollution, and that companies became  more efficient.  What they didn't have with their local data was global data. But now we have it. We have global  data on carbon emissions and on countries' global footprints. And this curve does not bend down.  Growth does not clean things up again. So to grow now and clean   up later does not work.  Countries with high footprints and high carbon emissions, it tracks up and up and up. It takes a  great deal of effort to even start trying to bend that curve down. So the idea that growth will  even things up and growth will clean up after itself, are compl ete fallacies from the 20th century.  And we must leave them behind and recognise that we need to create economies that are  regenerative and distributive by design.  Rohan Hazell:  Globalisation and technological advancements underpin our modern civilisation, but they have  also created 21st century challenges that cannot be resolved using 20th century approaches.  Today's economic models, policies and decision - making must therefore reflect the latest science,  data and evidence, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the purpose of the economy.  Kate Raworth invites us to reimagine our economic identity, encouraging a shift beyond outdated  models.

Sharan Burrow explained the critical need for a planned and transparent transition away from fossil fuels, involving governments, businesses, and workers collaboratively to address climate challenges and create a sustainable future.There is an urgent need for oil and gas companies to decide on an exit date from fossil fuels to initiate a planned transition away from fossil fuels, a process that should involve clear and accountable steps.Government leadership in making critical decisions on policy and legislative changes for climate action is essential, including the establishment of authorities or commissions for just transitions.Innovative initiatives like the world-first Scope 3 emissions report and ethical AI projects led by Australian business leaders showcase proactive industry involvement in climate and technology ethics.

  TRANSCRIPT  Managing a Just Transition: An Australian Example  Rohan Hazell :  The fossil fuel industry employs around 32 million people globally. As we begin to transition  away from oil and gas, how will these workers be treated?  This is a question that Sharan Burrow, former General Secretary of the International Trade  Union Confederation, has spent part of her recent career attempting to answer.  She stresses the need for decision - making that fosters cooperation among governments,  workers, companies, and the broader community to ensure a successful transition.  Sharan Burrow:  The fossil fuel industry employs around 32 million people globally. As we begin to transition  away from oil and gas, how will these workers be treated? This is a question that Sharan  Burrow, former general secretary of the International Trade Union Confede ration, has spent  part of her recent career attempting to answer. She stresses the need for decision making  that   fosters   cooperation   among   governments,   workers,   companies   and   the   broader  community to ensure a successful transition.  Well, I think you have to say to fossil fuel companies, you have to have an exit   date,   and that  transition has to be planned even before today. But   certainly,   from today, if we haven't  started for Australia, we lost more than a decade. I was still working in Australia as head of  the trade unions here.  The Australian Council of Trade Unions as its president. When we negotiated with the then  Labor government in 2008, with civil society, with green groups, with the unions and indeed  of course, government partners. The initial carbon trading scheme, it lost   by one vote. You  asked why we can't come to an agreement. In that case it was one political party making the  perfect the enemy of the good and declaring that it couldn't support what at that point, to be  fair, was a low carbon price.  But of course, you and I know you ratchet these things up. You put the mechanism in place.  So Australia lost a decade and they had a government who frankly were climate skeptics.  Despite the science, they were driven by the self - interest of the coal miners   who invested in
  climate and not coal miners, coal barons who invested in climate skepticism in their own  interest.  And I feel very angry about that. I'm also quite angry now with fossil fuel companies. You  know, I was one of the people who said to the divestment community around 2010, don't  divest, give those the fossil fuel companies, not coal, but oil and gas, who ha ve the CapEx, the  technology, the IP, the skilled workforce, the infrastructure, the demands to transition, to  have a transparent transition plan.  And okay, we've seen some shifting CapEx spending, but not enough. They're not serious.  They're still raking in the profit and often profits from illicit transfer flows from developed  countries to their own pockets. This has to change. And so we do have ho pe. We have hope  for green hydrogen. We have hope that that will not just help shift the heavy industry, but  the mining sector, the energy mix in itself.  But unless governments, employers and workers are at the table around those discussions  and what makes the transition along the way where we are exiting from, you know, the  industries that are simply climate unfriendly, then we will not meet the challenge   the situation  here in Australia today, I must say, and I've just returned literally from Belgium after 12 years  of being away, is much more optimistic than I've seen it.  You know, when I've returned for visits and discussions in all of those years. But Australia has  a lot to catch up on and could be deployed much more constructively, forests that actually  could be reinvested in. There's much to do, but much optimism.  What I do say, though, is the government's role is in both convening, certainly driving agreed  policy and legislative shifts or even if you can't get total agreement, predominant agreement  because governments have to lead. But for workers and indeed to dri ve the investment that  will mean to some extent blended finance from the public and the private sector in major  infrastructure.  We believe you need authorities. And so Australia is considering a transition of authority. We  have these authorities in other countries. Scotland has a just transition commission, but it in  an ongoing sense, but it also has indeed a minister for just tran sition. Sweden appointed an  industry minister who was my own deputy president a number of years ago and head of the  the labor union there, the fellow who'd gone to work when he stepped down as advisor to is  to say be steel in construction of or in producti on, I should say, of clean steel and then went  on to be minister.  Of course,   politics takes people in and out of the government role, but the government role  is critical. And I'm glad you're going to talk about that. But it's not it's not a unilateral role if  you don't have the outcome. You challenged me in the first beginning agr eements and how  do we get there if we don't have a commitment to getting consensus, to making it absolutely
  transparent to people that there's a future for the world in which we live, where jobs are  secure, where communities can look to the future with optimism, then we're going to fail.  So there is no option but for people to come together led by the government, but with  workers and indeed companies at the table. I'll just give you one example that I am very proud  of from Australia. The B - team group of employers here with a few of us as a dvisers from  unions, civil society and academia, they produce a world first in a scope three emissions  report from business themselves, from the CEOs.  And of course, you know, the competition policy constraints. But they got around those legally  where they could share data across a number of industries and actually set up a model for  assessing not just what scope three emissions exist, but where responsi bility lies for reducing  those emissions. They're doing the same now with ethical AI, and that's a whole other area  of conversation around decent work and of course around rights of civil society.  So, you know, there is much work to do. But if the workers, the business and the governments  aren't at the table with the broader community where to fix them, then we will fail. It's that  simple.  Rohan Hazell:  Transparent transformations and clear exit dates are necessary in ensuring a just transition  for workers in industries such as oil and gas who face uncertainty as demands on the fossil  fuel industry to limit production continue to rise.  While governments must play a crucial role in driving policy and legislative shifts, decision -  making must engage workers   and   companies to ensure that fundamental labour rights for  decent work and social protection are prioritised.

Redesigning Societal Systems

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the complexities of our societal systems. How we interact with one another at all levels, from the community to the international stage, is dependent on the actions and expectations of different actors, including governments, businesses, civil societies, and individuals.The concept of the social contract is central to societal systems, defining the tacit agreement of what is acceptable in society and what individuals, companies, and governments owe each other for a well-functioning, harmonious society. It can be observed in various aspects of daily life, such as public behaviour and hygiene.Multiple factors, including geopolitical shifts, technological advancements, demographic changes, climate change, and economic inequality have caused the social contract to fray, leading to anxiety and tension within society.Both governments and businesses play a role in shaping societal systems. Governments are responsible for protecting the public interest through tools like taxation and lawmaking, while businesses should consider their impact on society and the environment.Responsible businesses should consider societal expectations beyond legal compliance, aiming for a social license to operate, where the company's actions align with the values and standards of the society they operate in.Redesigning societal systems should be tailored to the unique context of each country, as one-size-fits-all approaches won't address the diverse challenges faced by different regions.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Societal Systems  Elaine Fernandez:  In this module, we've explored some of the key economic and governance redesigns that are  needed to make progress on addressing existential threats. This brings us to the third area in  need of a redesign: societal systems.  These refer, in their simplest form, to how we interact with and what we expect from one  another. This applies to our communities and organisations, all the way through to the ways our  societies engage in the international arena. So how can we start codifying the systems for a  redesign?  This is no small task, given societal systems are dynamic and ever changing, a product of  culture, history, development level, and more. However, what underlies them is something  known as the social contract. To explain what this is, we'll hear from the Managing Director of  the Global Institute for Tomorrow, Eric Stryson.  Eric Stryson:  What is the social contract? We can define it as the tacit agreement of what is or is not  acceptable in society. It's essentially what we expect of each other, or you could consider it  what we owe each other in a harmonious, well functioning society. But also how individuals and  businesses interact and understand and respond to each other.  Of course, we have demographic and cultural changes. We have ageing societies, we have  societies which are depopulating and where populations are reducing. And then we have macro  changes like climate change and social pressures around increased economic inequality. And so  all of these are factors which affect the social contract and what we expect of each other in  vastly different ways.  So it's really important to understand some of the forces which are shaping our modern social  contract. We have media and social polarisation. We have narratives which have driven people  
further and further apart into their echo chambers where we only listen to those opinions  which reinforce our particular view.  And unless we take the time to go and understand other people's point of view within society,  we will again have a social contract which is strained and fraying. We need to be aware of how  the social contract is changing, what those stressors are on the social contract, and anticipate  the changes in society. We may need to engage stakeholders in new ways and appreciate the  demands and the expectations from those stakeholders in ways that we didn't anticipate  before.  Elaine Fernandez:  In your country, the social contract influences you every day from how you interact with other  members of society to how you cross the road to how companies make business decisions and  the policies your government chooses to enact. But every country has its own unique social  contract. It changes and evolves based on internal and external factors, like political sentiment,  the state of the economy, or national crises like pandemics, conflicts and natural disasters.  Choosing to wear or not wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, also relates  to the social contract and what we believe to be our duty of care to others. To redesign our  systems and protect against existential threats, we need to have a robust social contract in  which different social actors interact with one another in a balanced, respectful, and reciprocal  way. A big part of this is understanding that respecting different views is a prerequisite for  taking decisions that benefit the individual, as well as the collective.  To demonstrate this, we'll now hear from Professor Wang Hui of Tsinghua University, one of the  leading Chinese academic institutions, who will elevate the discussion of redesigning our  societal systems to the international level.  Prof. Wang Hui:  A lot of the people, even from the Western countries, talk a lot about multilateralism and the  plural civilizations and so on and so forth, which I think is a shared wisdom. A lot of people talk  
about the UN reform, for example, whether or not the small countries, for example, or different  social groups will have a voice in the rulemaking process.  So that when we talk about the rules based order, we need to question the rulemaking process  because it is more democratic or only dominated by single powers or some group of powers and  for their domination. In that sense, democracy in the global level is important, means that  different countries, different cultures have some voices in the new world.  Elaine Fernandez:  Professor Wang Hui has illustrated how our societal systems play out at the international level,  given that cultural norms influence how entire countries and regions interact with one another.  This should give you an indication. of just how important societal systems are to creating the  conditions for a successful redesign.  After all, international cooperation is vital for preventing existential threats like conflict, and will  help spur collaboration and innovation to tackle other global challenges, like inequality and  climate change.  Now let's hear from Christine Loh, who will help clarify precisely how societal systems shape the  public and private sectors.  Prof. Christine Loh:  So a responsible business will hopefully think about after complying with the law, what you do  and how you do it, does it comply with the social, the societal expectation of what a good  company would do. So, for example, you are paying the minimum wage. But could you do  better under certain circumstances?  What kind of society are you in? What would provide a certain living, uh, standard for that  society? And are you rewarding people at a level that your business can afford, and [00:08:00]  that it's better for society? So, I think the idea of social licence to operate actually is one bar up  from mere legal compliance, and generally it's an indication that a company that has the social  licence to operate from people. People generally feel quite good about that company because  they regard that as a good and responsible company in their society.  
So there could be, let's say, a new idea in society, for example, to protect the environment, not  to people pollute as much as they used to. Companies will have to obey these when laws are  passed. But there is a period of time before new laws are in place. So this is why responsible  companies would actually go above.  The legal compliance, but the role of government to guard the public interest is what we want  our governments to do, and only they have the tools to reflect it and to protect society. So  they're able to tax people, they're able to pass laws that people have to obey. Uh, they can give  subsidies and incentives and penalties.  So therefore, all these tools that governments have. They're there to create a better society,  which is why government has to be clear about how they use these tools for the public interest.  Elaine Fernandez:  Clearly, the public and private sectors do not operate in a vacuum. They are, in all countries,  partly a product of the societal systems that underlie them. However, it can be easy for  government officials not to take into account the needs of diverse stakeholders. When making  decisions that impact multiple segments of society.  Equally, businesses all too often push legal and ethical boundaries in the quest for growth,  rather than considering the needs of society and impact on the natural world. So how can we  make progress on these fronts? As we'll hear from GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair, it starts  with the individual and that means you.  Chandran Nair:  The average person can do one thing and it's called participate, participate, participate. That's  the critical thing. The average person participates not by being necessarily an activist, not by  being an economist, an expert in rural development, not by necessarily being a climate change  specialist, or a specialist on political systems.  They participate by being citizens. And that is important. I've often said that the role of  education is just to create a responsible citizen and a responsible citizen is one who is alerted to  the issues in their society. They don't have to be a political animal. They have insights. They are  curious.  
Most importantly, they are not going to leave the future of this society simply to others and  think that others will fix it. We need to exert our citizenship, and it's not simply through the  exercise of voting in a democracy. It's engaging, for instance, in looking at your community, in  the part of the town or the city you live in, participating in things to do with welfare,  participating in providing contributions to reform and participating in education systems. Even  in terms of simple things like improving the waste management system in your community.  And that's what redesign looks like.  Elaine Fernandez:  In this module, you've been encouraged to think critically about how we run our economies,  governments, and societies. There is a need to redesign these systems to be more resilient  against the existential threats of the 21st century. We should also understand that the pathways  to these transformations will be very different for different parts of the world.  A singular approach cannot solve every country's challenges. Rather, each country will have to  define what progress and prosperity means in its own context, and from there, how to build and  sustain more resilient and equitable societies. Fortunately, from public policy to business model  innovation and social organisation, countries have been navigating systemic change in their own  way for centuries.  We'll explore this further in the last component of redesigning society, coming up next.

The Ethical Dilemmas of Technology

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson highlighted the complex ethical dilemmas that stem from technological advancements, urging a proactive approach to addressing these issues.The rise of AI and automation poses ethical challenges regarding labour displacement, raising concerns about employment, purpose, and societal roles.Advanced technologies like genetic engineering present profound ethical questions about the essence of being human and the limits of our manipulation of human nature.Digital technologies' capacity for surveillance and data collection raises ethical concerns about privacy, consent, and the implications for access to services and discrimination.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Ethical Dilemmas of Technology  Tsubasa Nair:  From gunpowder to the Internet, every leap in the march of technological advancement has  come riddled with its own set of ethical concerns.  And these ethical implications can affect how we interact with the world and each other. The  way we develop, deploy, and regulate these advancements raises crucial questions: Who  benefits from these innovations? Who is left behind? And are there limits to their applications?  To unpack these questions and more, let's hear from Eric Stryson, managing director of the  Global Institute for Tomorrow.  Eric Stryson:  Clearly, technology has many ethical questions that it raises. And with every new technology  that has a significant impact on society, we need to be willing and able to ask the challenging  ethical questions. I think the question that many are asking now with artificial intelligence,  which   is   essentially   an   extension   of   the   mechanical   automation   which   we   have   been  experiencing through robotics and the automation of mechanical processes, is how will we deal  with the displacement of more and more workers, particularly now so called knowledge  workers, with the introduction broadly, of algorithms and AI in different industries.  And so it is an ethical dilemma about to what extent we should allow AI to penetrate and  displace workers. Because fundamentally, people in society need gainful employment, not just  to earn money and to therefore be able to live on the economy, but also to have a sense of  purpose, and to feel productive and have a sense of meaning within society.  So I think this is creating great ethical questions and needs to be reflected in good policy  making.  Other advanced technologies, like bioengineering, genetic engineering, raise even trickier  questions about how we understand the nature of being human, and what we can and should  be able to do to modify our human experience. If we accept that we have the technology and  
we want to put it to good use, how do we ensure that the access to these types of technologies  is distributed equitably? Or will we find ourselves in a situation where the ability to manipulate  human beings and to manipulate the next generation of babies that are being born is accessible,  roughly to the extent that people can pay for it, and then those that have financial means will  be able to modify themselves, and those that don't, will not.  And this again sets up some very tricky ethical dilemmas about how we should be looking to use  these kinds of technologies, certainly in relation to digital technologies, the ability for the state  and other commercial actors to surveil and to gain vast amounts of data about users of the  technologies, and how that data is used, and how it is then reflected in individuals ability to  access services.  The cost of services like health insurance, other types of insurance in society also raises ethical  dilemmas. But if we don't talk about these dilemmas, then we then tend to just race towards  integrating these new technologies, and then go through a process of a sort of backfilling and  catching up later. But in many ways, then, the damage is done, and we are only trying to  therefore mitigate the harm rather than getting ahead of these ethical questions.  Tsubasa Nair:  When we view technology through the lens of ethics, we can pursue its potential while  navigating its pitfalls. After all, as the rate of technological advancement grows and begins  pushing boundaries, we will increasingly be confronted with ethical questions that demand  nuance   and   thoughtful   consideration.   The responsibility lies with us not just as passive  consumers, but as active participants in shaping the future.  For every new innovation, we must ask ourselves, how does this technology serve humanity?  Does it empower us or control us?

The Death Vs Life Economy

### keyTakeaway
According to John Perkins, our modern economic ideologies, based on the thinking of economists over a century ago, have resulted in a destructive "death economy" that exploits resources without regard for the long-term consequences.The consequences of prioritising short-term gains - as encouraged by the thinking of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Von Hayek - have led to the creation of a "death economy" that depletes resources and disregards environmental sustainability, jeopardising the planet's future.Contrary to the prevailing paradigm, human history has predominantly featured a "life economy," emphasising sustainability and long-term wellbeing, a stark departure from the recent trend towards the "death economy."The power to drive change lies in the hands of individuals who can influence corporate behaviour through their choices as consumers, employees, and investors.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Death Vs Life Economy  Rohan Hazell:  Historical economic thinkers like Milton Friedman championed short - term profit maximisation,  which have, in part, led to a global shift in business ethos, ultimately neglecting community  welfare and environmental sustainability.  How can we move toward an improved economic paradigm?  We speak to John Perkins, author of the best - selling Confessions of an Economic Hitman, to find  out more. He compares the modern unsustainable, profit - driven 'death economy' with the  possibility of creating a sustainable, society - enhancing 'life economy'.  John Perkins:  Both Friedman and Von Hayek won the Nobel Prize and Friedman in ‘76, Von Hayek a few years  earlier. But Friedman was extremely popular around the world.  Y ou know, he was popular with President Reagan in the United States and Thatcher, and he was  popular throughout many parts of Asia and Latin America. So, he had a huge influence. And, you  know, this idea of maximising profits is a sick idea. It's insanity.   That's not what business should  be about.  When I was in business school before Friedman, before he won the Nobel Prize, I was taught that  a good CEO makes a decent rate of return, but he also takes good care of his employees, gives  them health benefits, insurance and retirement funds. And takes go od care of the community  where his businesses operate. Gives money to local organisations, school systems, et cetera. And  that all changed after those two economists got the Nobel Prize and Friedman spread the word  around the world and things really fell a part.  We've created what I like to call a ‘death economy’, an economic system that is consuming and  polluting itself into extinction. It's not a viable long - term economy. It's based totally on short -  term. We used to think of short term as the annual report, then   it was the quarterly report. Now  it's the daily stock market, and it's a terribly greedy, self - centred, selfish viewpoint, and it also  looks at human beings as supreme over everything else. So, we have the right to destroy nature  in the short run, in orde r to ravage nature, in order to create, maximise profits with no thought  at all to the long term, even to our own children and grandchildren.
  And incidentally, this is very unusual in human history. Throughout the 250,000 years or so that  we've considered ourselves as humans, we've almost always had a life economy, an economic  system that's self - sustaining, where people replant after they cut, w here they, you know, where  they're very conscious of the long term. And that's still true in many of the indigenous cultures.  Well, there're not so many left anymore, but they're the ones that are left.  So, it's only been within the last couple of thousand years that we've even headed in this other  direction. And it's been particularly since World War II, and especially in the last few decades and  even the last few years that we've gone more and more towa rd this idea of the ‘death economy’.  We need to stop it because it's killing us. It's going to kill life on this planet as we know life on this  planet to be.  The ‘life economy’ is a sustainable system.  First of all, its goal is not maximising short - term profits. It's maximising long - term benefits for all  life. All life. And you know, it will pay people to clean up pollution. You know, to mine the plastic  that's floating around in the oceans and recycle i t to regenerate destroyed environments, to  recycle and to develop technologies that don't ravage the earth where we can reuse, I mean,  everything we need is here. and, you know, we just have to be a little more creative, and move  into alternative energy. I t's a rejuvenative system. It in itself is regenerative. And you know, I'd  like to say we're on the way to that. We've been on the way to that.  The pandemic and now the war between Russia and Ukraine has set us back a little bit. Before  the pandemic, we really were exploring benefit corporations, B corporations, co - ops, the Green  New Deal in the United States and, and elsewhere, conscious capitali sm.  There's been a movement and still is a movement in the direction of really understanding that  we must change, that we simply must change. And of course, the big problem is that major  corporations today are controlled by Wall Street. They're controlled by i nvestors and hedge funds  which demand short - term profits.  But it's important that we, the people, all of us understand that although we're victims of the  system, we're also the perpetuators of the system, that we're the collaborators. It works because  we buy from these companies. We work for these companies. We r un these companies and we  invest in these companies, and so that gives us a lot of power. Because of that, we can change  these companies. It takes an effort and we all must get involved in doing it.  Rohan Hazell:
  By its very nature, an economy that prioritises short - term financial gain over long - term value  creation for people and the planet is not a viable model for sustainable development.  An economy that is forward - looking, inclusive and regenerative in nature is one that maximises  long - term benefits for all life on Earth instead of short - term shareholder returns.

The Doughnut: Measuring Human Prosperity

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Kate Raworth presented the Doughnut model, emphasising the urgent need to balance meeting essential human needs with respecting planetary boundaries and highlighting the disparities in how different countries are currently positioned relative to these goals.The Doughnut model illustrates the dual challenge of eliminating poverty and deprivation without exceeding ecological boundaries, a balance not yet achieved globally.Data shows billions are deprived of life essentials, while simultaneously, many countries overshoot ecological limits, revealing the scale of the challenge.The histories and futures of nations are deeply interconnected through colonialism, trade, and climate impacts, necessitating a global, cooperative approach to transformation.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Doughnut: Measuring Human Prosperity  Rohan Hazell:  The Doughnut   Economics model, popularised by Oxford economist, Kate Raworth, is a  groundbreaking framework redefining economic success in the 21st century.  Beyond mere GDP metrics, it balances essential human needs with our planet's health. Together  with Kate Raworth, we'll examine the Doughnut model in the context of disparities in wealth and  resource consumption, and how we can create a thriving future for   humanity with a different  understanding of prosperity.  Kate Raworth:  The Doughnut offers us one possible vision of humanity, thriving this century. And if that space  of balancing in the Doughnut is where we want to be, well, we are very far from that right now.  This is the Doughnut with data plotted onto it for the whole world. We can see from all the red  in the middle that billions of people worldwide are falling short on the essentials of life. That red  wedge on food, for example, goes 11% of the way towards th e centre of the circle because 11%  of people worldwide do not have enough food to eat every day. And it's true on every one of  these social dimensions.  We want to eliminate all the red from the middle of this picture. But at the same time, we are  already overshooting multiple planetary boundaries. And by the way, the science is coming out  soon to say that we actually are overshooting more than this. So, i t's a double whammy of a  challenge. We need to get everybody out of poverty and deprivation while already coming back  within planetary boundaries.  You know, we've never done this before. We've never tried to do this before. So last century's  economic theories, last century's business models and government policies and community  action and lifestyles, none of them were designed to turn this story arou nd. We need to redesign  all of those when we face this reality that is ours, of our generation and our time, and I show this  to people and I say that our children and their children, they will ask us, they will. What did you
  do once that you knew? What did you do in all of your networks of influence when you were at  work, when you were at home, in your community, in your, in your politics? What did you do to  bring about the transformation that's required?  All these headlines here, tell us the story every day in the news of the overshoot that we have  created and the extraordinary threat that we are posing now to life on the planet. And we know  that these threats are already, of course, hitting back on people 's lives. Food shortages, water,  energy crises, climate change impacts. And let's recognise that the richest 1% of people in the  world own half the wealth. This is the one statistic, I find it hardest to get my head around. The  richest 1% own half the worl d. This is an insane, insane situation.  The American writer William S. Burroughs said, "After taking one look at this planet, any visitor  from out of space would say, I want to see the manager." And we have to ask ourselves, who  would we take this visitor from out of space to see? Governments, f or sure. CEO's for sure, and  economists.  Economics, if it's the art of household management, the mindset that we teach and we learn  when we learn economics surely has a responsibility. So how can we turn around the story and  the way we manage our planetary home? Now I'm showing you here the plane t as a whole. But  of course, action happens much closer to home, and there are vast differences in responsibility  between nations and between people who brought us to this place. So let's look at some national  Doughnuts. Here's just four.  We can see on one end, Malawi, on around one and $1,500 per person per year. A lot of human  shortfall, but they're not overshooting planetary boundaries, their share of, in any capacity.  China, a double whammy. significant human shortfall, already overshoo ting multiple planetary  boundaries, that's a double whammy of a challenge to turn around. I'm going to jump to the  United States on $64,000 a person. Still significant inequality in the nation. And of course we  know there's deprivation within the U.S., but   compared to people around the world, it's  significantly better on the social story.  But look at that overshoot, massive ecological overshoot. And then let me come back to  Denmark, or it could have been Sweden, or it could have been Norway, because people always  see, oh, but surely Scandinavia, surely Scandinavia is doing it. No, no, they' re not. They are  overshooting planetary boundaries just like every high income country. There's not a single  country in the world that we know of that could say it's living in the Doughnut. There's one that's  closer than any other. It's Costa Rica. Costa R ica is closer to meeting the needs of its people
  almost within the boundaries of the living planet, on around $22,000 per person per year. This  surely must give us hope, because not even the government of Costa Rica has actively tried to  get into the Doughnut.  None of these countries have actually been governing themselves with an economic mindset,  with governmental policies, with business models that would intentionally bring us there. So  there's a possibility of turning this story around. Let me show you one m ore.  Around 50 countries on a scatter plot. Now the sweet spot is that top left hand corner, that is  where no one is falling short. So we come up out of a shortfall, so no one is left falling short, but  we've come back within those planetary boundaries. So, num ber one, there's not a single country  in there. And that's why I would say there's no such thing as a developed country. I can't think of  a country in the world that has the right to call itself a developed country, an advanced nation.  I'm sorry, not one of the rich countries has the right to call itself that. Look at their overshoot. All  that red. We're all developing countries now, in the sense that we must all have the humility and  ambition to transform the direction that our countrie s are going in. And I'm sitting here in the  UK, for heaven's sake. This is a country that, like all high - income countries, has to be a developing  nation in this sense of 21st century transformation.  Now, let's look at the low income countries, that long stream falling down. We've got Malawi,  Tanzania, Central African Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, India. These nations have the challenge of  meeting the needs of all of their people coming up without oversho oting planetary boundaries  to the scale that every nation before them has done.  How will they do that? It's never been done before. This is an unprecedented journey. Middle -  income nations. Let's talk about Mexico, Iran, Turkey, China, Russia, Paraguay, Brazil. The ones  that cluster in the middle, they have the double whammy challenge.   They still have to meet the  needs of all their people, but they already need to be coming back within planetary boundaries.  This hasn't been done before. And then the high - income nations, those big red overshoots sitting  at the top, they need to continue to meet the needs of all their people. And in fact, they already  don't do that. We know there's deprivation even in the riche st of countries. They need to meet  the needs of all their people and come back within planetary boundaries on a scale that has never  been seen before. This too is unprecedented. And let's not forget that although these countries  stand like separate dots on   the scatter plots, their histories and futures are profoundly  interconnected through histories of colonialism.
  I'm sitting in the UK. I have to acknowledge that right now, through military power and corporate  power, through trade and finance rules, through ongoing resource extraction, through the  current and future impacts of climate change. So every nation needs t o transform within, and we  need a transformation of all between, because these impacts, of course, predominantly are  created by those in the global north, impacting upon the global south. We need transformation.  Rohan Hazell:  Not a single nation currently exists within the safe space of the Doughnut. While high - income  countries may be able to provide higher quality of life for their citizens, they are exceeding  multiple planetary boundaries in doing so.  High - , middle -   and low - income countries will inevitably have different development priorities.  Local solutions rooted in local cultures and contexts, as well as cooperation between countries  are therefore needed to meaningfully tackle the unprecedented cha llenge of living within the  Doughnut.

What is Modern-Day Globalisation?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair illustrated what modern-day globalisation entails, and offered an overview of the opportunities, challenges and risks it presents.There are varied interpretations of what globalisation constitutes, ranging from the ability to access global markets to having access to travel internationally. While globalisation can bring abundant opportunities, it also entails contradictions and risks.Globalisation is a multifaceted phenomenon that extends beyond commercial terms and involves the integration of economies, industries, markets, cultures, and policymaking worldwide. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen's suggestion that globalisation is often seen as global Westernisation is a perspective that has garnered much agreement, and is now resulting in tensions between geopolitical blocs.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  What is Modern-Day Globalisation?  Rohan Hazell:  For many of us, globalisation means something to do with commerce and trade. But there is a  wider context that needs to be explored because it directly impacts the way we live and how we  organise our societies.  You’ll learn more from Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, who discusses the fact that  globalisation is ever-evolving and cannot be stopped.  Chandran Nair:  What is very clear is that we all, I think, agree that we live in a very globalised 21st century. But  all of us have very different ideas about what that globalisation actually means.  For some of us, globalisation has something to do with the digital era. For others, it has  something to do with perhaps the ability to trade and buy things from different parts of the  world and have them delivered in two days. For others, globalisation might mean the ability to  consume food from other parts of the world that they never before were able to access.  But what is clear is that for most of us, globalisation is viewed as something that's exciting. We  always see it as something that offers opportunities, more and more opportunities. But at the  same time, it does provide contradictions and risk. And that's something a thoughtful individual  in the 21st century needs to be conscious about. And I would urge you all to start thinking about  the globalised world in a much more expansive way than perhaps the narrow ways that most of  us are accustomed to thinking about.  So, what is modern day globalisation? As I said before, we often think about it in very  commercial terms – in terms of business discussions, in terms of contracts, technology, but it's  actually much more multifaceted. Here are two definitions that I hope will help you. The first is  by the Financial Times. It says “Globalisation is the integration of economies, industries,  markets, culture, and policy making around the world.” This is a very comprehensive definition  of globalisation. It embraces everything. But as they say, the devil is in the details. And I'll ask  you to sort of think about it.  
But that's the Financial Times definition. It’s generally a positive definition about the fact that  the integration results in better outcomes for the world at large.  On the other hand, Amartya Sen, the Indian economist and Nobel Laureate, looked at it in this  way. He said, “Globalisation is often seen as global Westernisation. On this point, there's  substantial agreement among many proponents and opponents.” Many non-Westerners do see  globalisation as the export of Western ideas, products, lifestyles, and in fact, business practices  too. For most, they have accepted this as a positive thing, but in the last few, I think the last  decade at least, there has been a bit of a backlash. And this backlash has now resulted in  tensions between different geopolitical blocs - the United States and China, Europe, and the rest  of the world, et cetera, because the Westernisation of the world comes with challenges too, for  the rest of the world. And therein lie new ways of how we think about what the future of  globalisation should be.  Rohan Hazell:  On   one   hand, globalisation involves the integration of industries, markets, cultures, and  policymaking around the world.  On the other hand, it has also been called synonymous with Westernisation, in so far as it has  promoted the export of Western ideas, products, and lifestyles.  These contrasting views mean a re-evaluation is occurring in all parts of the world, bringing with  it the latest version of globalisation.

Population Growth and Resource Constraints

### keyTakeaway
This chapter introduced the first two drivers of change: population growth and resource constraints. You heard from GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair about how these trends are closely related, and will shape how businesses and markets evolve, as well as how governments interact with one another and craft policy. In the 21st century, six major drivers of change are shaping human and natural systems. These include resource constraints, population growth, the crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, the shifting world order, and climate change. The world's population is expected to reach approximately 10 billion by 2050, with significant growth in developing countries. This population growth exerts pressure on natural resources, leading to challenges related to resource sustainability and access, especially in urban mega-cities.Competition for key resources like water, oil, rare earths, and minerals is causing domestic and geopolitical challenges. For example, the growing global population is causing water scarcity, which is compounded by climate change. Managing these tensions and resources will be essential in the coming years.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Population Growth and Resource Constraints  Elaine Fernandez :  Drivers of change are the global mega trends influencing human and natural systems in the  21st century. There are six of them, and these are: population growth, resource constraints,  the crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, the shifting world order,   and climate change.  It's important to build a deeper understanding of these megatrends if we are to make any  progress in redesigning society. Awareness of these drivers of change will help you recognize  that the conventional wisdom which guides our governments, economies, bus iness models,  and even education systems are not up to the task. Let's explore the first two drivers:  population growth and resource constraints.  Chandran Nair:  The world today in 2022 has a population of about 8 billion people. It is expected that the  world's population will peak at about 10 billion by 2050. That exponential growth in  population has put tremendous pressure on natural resources. That pressure on n atural  resources has been accompanied with the human ability to essentially extract and use  resources in ways that obviously improve quality of life.  We now also understand it is extremely wasteful because we thought we lived in a world with  abundance. What has also happened is that in the last 30, 40 years, as the developing  countries of the world started to embrace the idea of economic growth, there's   been a shift  of economic activity and prosperity creation from the rich world to the poorer world. This is  important, but at the same time does create a huge amount of tension.  How much growth through the use of natural resources can billions of people using resources  sustain? How can the planet sustain all of this?  By 2050, two in every five children will be born in Africa. Africa will have the youngest  population in the world. The average age in India will be 29 years old, and in Nigeria about 18  years old by 2050. The population in 2050 in Asia will be around 5.5 b illion people. In Africa it  will be about 2.5 billion people compared with Europe, where it will only be about 700 million  people; and the United States of America where it will be about 400 or 450 million people.  So you can all see that the population issue is one of both the exponential growth of the  human, human species, putting tremendous pressure on natural resources, including flora
  and fauna, but it's also being distributed in ways where that growth will primarily be in the  poorer countries. How they navigate that will be extremely challenging, but also unique to  the 21st century.  An interesting feature of this population factor is also that in the 21st century, ageing  populations will become a major challenge for governments and societies to deal with. We'll  see large ageing populations in North America, Europe, and Asia. How will   this change the  economies? How will governments have to deal with that?  What sort of caring will we be able to afford and provide for ageing populations? And in terms  of the ageing issue, how to provide care for the populations with fewer working and even look  at how pension schemes work and who will care for these people and   all of those things. The  growth of urban populations at current trends will create situations that many governments  will find very difficult to manage.  Today, the city of Mumbai in India has a population of about 25 million. That's the population  of Australia and a bit more. It is expected that if we continue to urbanise in the way that we  are at the moment, cities like Mumbai will have a population of ab out 40 million by 2050. And  most of these large cities will be in the developing world.  These will include Delhi, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo,  Kolkata, Lagos, Karachi, and the rich cities that fall into this bracket will just be a few –   Tokyo,  New York City, perhaps.  The main challenge of urbanisation with rising populations and the trend of concentration of  populations in megacities will be the difficulty of providing basic needs to these large urban  populations.  We've already seen the inability of many urban centres to provide proper housing, water,  sanitation and energy for these large, large populations. Transport networks seem unable to  cope with the movement of people in these large cities. So how will these g overnments  essentially have to deal with this?  Should we completely reverse our thinking about urbanisation and think about how we  essentially disperse populations and not have the concentration of populations in one or two  large cities? There are many, many parts of the developing world where up to 20   to 30% of  the population are concentrated in one or two large cities, and the hinterland is almost  deserted, which has implications for how food is grown, the pricing of resources and the  disproportionate sort of pull that urban populations have on energy   needs and materials. We  all know that from the evidence that the human population is having a major impact on the  resources of the world. 2.7 billion people today experience water scarcity.
  In Southeast Asia, where there's a tropical climate, the idea that there would be water scarcity  was not something that even people thought about 30, 40 years ago. Today, these are issues  brought about both by climate change, but also by the demand for gro wing populations for  water, industrial use, farming, and all of those. By 2025, two - thirds of the world's population  will be facing water shortages. In many cities in India, Africa, etc., access to water is a daily  struggle. It's a burden that many people   live with.  Most of us are aware that resources are becoming an issue that societies around the world  are having to confront. And as the populations in different countries rise, especially in Asia  and Africa, water scarcity is going to be a threat and an issue of soci al consequences that  many governments will have to deal with.  One in nine people globally do not even get enough to eat even. And these are all related to  the way we use our resources, the way climate is affecting us, and the way land use, planning,  and   agriculture   is   practiced.   These   are   data   points   that   are   sometim es   difficult   to  comprehend. Imagine that forest land, the size of the United Kingdom, is lost every year.  That we are clearing this because of our inability to manage these resources. But at the same  time, our rush to produce food and other goods to keep our consumption - driven economy  alive. So resource conservation management will become perhaps the toughest   challenge of  our societies.  Competition for key resources is the cause of domestic and geopolitical tensions, even in the  United States, there is tension between states for water –   between California and Colorado  State. So all around the world, we are seeing this between nations as we ll. How would China  and India share the common water resources arising in the Tibetan Plateau?  These geopolitical tensions have to be managed. Oil, rare earths, minerals, and as I've already  mentioned, water. These issues to do with resource management and system collapse were  in fact part of a seminal report by the Club of Rome produced in 1972. It   was called The Limits  to Growth and became the sort of report that everyone then began to understand with regard  to the sustainability debate.  In 2022, the Club of Rome produced a new report called Earth for All. That does some very  new modelling to look at how resource constraints with a population peaking at 10 billion will  require five major transformations in the way we live our lives and how   governance systems  in particular will need to adapt to the conditions that humanity is likely to face over the next  50 years.  Elaine Fernandez:  Exponential population growth on a planet with finite resources has inevitably led to scarcity  of many vital raw materials. As you'll explore in the coming modules, the relationship
  between these drivers of change   –   one social and one environmental   –   lays the foundation  for the existential challenges faced by our societies.

Corporate Citizenship and Externalities

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair broke down the imperative for companies to internalise their externalities and the broader economic benefits of doing so, as well as the government’s role in incentivising and regulating businesses to fulfil their societal obligations.Internalising the costs of externalities, like pollution, is often seen as burdensome for companies, but this overlooks the broader economic gains, such as improved public health and reduced societal costs from pollution-related illnesses.Forward-thinking companies are recognising the need to redesign their business models to account for these externalities, understanding that the economic benefits outweigh the costs of change.Governments play a crucial role in incentivising companies to address externalities by creating innovative policies that level the playing field and collaborating with the private sector to implement viable solutions.Profit-making is part of a social contract: companies are responsible for the impact of the goods and services they sell. There is no inherent “right” to a profit if making it damages people or the environment.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Corporate Citizenship and Externalities  Elaine Fernandez:  The unaccounted-for costs of certain business activities can be extremely large because they sit  at the very centre of some business models. Just think of the uncompensated damage to  workers in the supply chains of fast fashion.  For this reason, addressing externalities is often seen as a tremendous burden for companies.  But governments, businesses, and consumers alike are all recognising that externalities with a  large impact should be mitigated, as part of a new wave of corporate responsibility.  This is the argument put forward by Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, in this chapter.  Chandran Nair:  When we start talking about internalising the costs, the first reaction in the traditional way we  look at things, and not just from business people, but for anybody is, “Well, this would be costly  for companies.” Well, costly in what way? Are we going to look at the cost of pollution impacts  on society if we're going to reduce the costs of that pollution impact?  Let's take, for example, say, pollution from factories that have affected tens of thousands of  people in a particular region, et cetera. That is a huge economic cost, right?  So if we're going to go and now reduce that pollution so that, you know, 16-year-olds now do  not get lung cancer when they're 25 years old, and then live a life where they have disabilities of  all sorts from pollution, that's a huge economic gain. So then companies have to do something  different, there are many things you can do, because, as I've said earlier, the cost of the change  is essentially the cost of remodelling your business model.  When you have a regulatory framework that then supports your ability and your desire to  remodel your business model, that then allows the state and the private sector to partner in  
ways that then has the bigger impact, which is the social benefits. So the benefits cannot be  simply seen from the point of view of, well, if it's not good for the company, it can’t be good for  society. This is a very old way of thinking.  As I often say, if we are good in business, you can't assume that because you're in a business,  you have a right to a profit. I keep having to tell people this, and I would like people to know  this. You can make profit, but the profit you make is part of a social contract.  And that social contract is a contract that allows you to have a certain impact with the  externalities of the goods and services you produce, which are deemed necessary for society,  and you can make a profit from that. But if that goods and service you produce creates  disastrous consequences over time for a region, a population, then you don't have a right to  that business model, nor the margins.  And that's the social contract society and the government imposes on. And that's reflected then  in the pricing. But a lot of people in business think that they just have a right to a profit. No, you  don't. The goods and services you provide are meant to have a positive impact. People buy it  because it is there to serve a need, sometimes a desire. The government allows you to operate  because it's seen as something that society would benefit from.  It agrees that there are certain externalities, and then it starts to impose rules and regulations  that compel you then to price it. So there's no free ride on profits. And there cannot be this  assumption that it will impose a price, that price imposition in terms of cleaning up, is the  calculus that is at the centre of the social contract.  Elaine Fernandez:  Internalising the cost of externalities such as pollution, is often viewed as a burden for  companies. But this perspective overlooks the broader economic benefits, like improving public  health and reducing societal costs from pollution-related illnesses.  This is why forward-thinking companies are increasingly seeking to redesign their business  models to account for externalities. But they cannot act alone. Governments have a vital role in  incentivising companies and "levelling the playing field" through innovative policymaking, and  by collaborating with the private sector to create and implement viable solutions.

Exploring Political Meritocracy in China 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Daniel Bell explained the concept of political meritocracy, particularly in the context of China, where it involves selecting and promoting public officials based on ability and virtue.In China, there is no strict division between civil servants and politicians; they are selected through meritocratic means like examinations and performance evaluations.Chinese officials gain diverse experiences across different levels of government and sectors, like villages, cities, and state-run enterprises. This breadth of experience is designed to inform their decision-making at higher levels.Virtue in political meritocracy is defined by a motivation to serve the public rather than personal interests. The fight against corruption is crucial, as corruption poses an existential threat to the system, unlike in electoral democracies where corrupt leaders can be replaced through elections.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Exploring Political Meritocracy in China  Elaine Fernandez:  China’s political system is the subject of much debate and discussion.  But how well do you understand it?  In this governance deep dive, we speak with Professor Daniel Bell, Chair of Political Theory at the  University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law.  Professor Bell provides his insight into China’s system of political meritocracy. He explains the  pros and cons of China’s approach and helps shine a light on the largest political system in the  world.  Professor Daniel Bell:  So political meritocracy is the idea that the political system should aim to select and promote  public officials with superior ability and virtue. And in western political systems, typically, you  have a kind of meritocratic system at the level of a civil s ervice. And theoretically, there's a  division between the elected politicians who are selected by means of elections, and the civil  servants who are elected by meritocratic means, such as examinations.  And they're supposed to implement the decisions of elected politicians. Now, in China, actually,  both in ancient China, in an imperial system as well as in China now, there's no strict division  between civil servants and politicians. They're all public off icials who both, at the lower levels of  government, spend more time implementing and at the high levels of government, more time  deciding. So what's fascinating about China, of course, there's like any other political system,  there's a big gap between the   ideal and the reality. But there's been a very strong effort to revive  political meritocracy over the past few decades in China.  I mean, a standard trope in the West is that there's no political reform in China because it's still  a   one - party   kind of communist system that hasn't changed. For those of us who know about
  Chinese history, the system now is radically different than, for example, in the cultural  Revolution, when it was pretty much arbitrary one - man rule.  Since then, there's been a very strong effort to re - establish a kind of political meritocracy that  informs us very similar to what you had in imperial China, where the public officials first go  through examinations and then they're promoted based on perfor mance evaluations at lower  levels of government. So in a political meritocracy, ideally, the public officials would show that  they're successful at lower levels of government in different fields.  In the case of China, they serve sometimes in villages, sometimes in counties, sometimes in cities,  and sometimes they work as well in state - run enterprises. So as the public officials rise  throughout the political system, they're supposed to have a divers e kind of experience that's  relevant for decision making. So ideally, when they get near or at the top of the decision - making  apparatus, they have the ability and experience to make informed political judgments that affect  diverse political constituencies.  Of course, this idea of political meritocracy, it's supposed to assess ability, but it's also supposed  to assess virtue. And virtue really means the willingness and the motivation to serve the public,  rather than to misuse public resources for one's own or   one's family interests.  So that's why corruption is literally an existential threat to a kind of political meritocracy, because  it means that the public officials are not doing what they're supposed to be doing, namely, serving  the political community. I mean, in an electoral dem ocracy, corruption is often regarded as bad,  but it's not an essential threat because theoretically, the leaders can be removed from political  power, whereas in a political meritocracy, the challenge is how to reduce corruption while still  allowing politic al decision - makers to take a long - term vision and not being worried about short -  term political payback.  So, select for virtue, basically, it's not meant to be that complicated. I mean, the opposite of virtue  is corruption, right? Instead of serving the community, you serve yourself or your family. So there  was much more emphasis on this, on promoting officia ls who are virtuous in the sense of not  being corrupt in the Xi era compared to before, precisely because corruption reached a point  where it posed an existential threat to the political system. Now, there are more particular areas  of virtue that, I mean,   China is a very diverse country.  So, for example, in Shandong province, in Qufu, which is the kind of home ground of Confucian  culture, there's strong emphasis on filial piety. So public officials would be promoted partly
  according to whether they are filial to their elderly parents. And that might work in Qufu because  of its dominant political culture, but it might not work in other parts of China.  So again, China is hugely diverse. So in the future, there's going to be a need for very, very creative  decision - makers that implement policies that are sensitive to China's diversity. People outside of  China, they think of it as this kind of monolithic co untry where 90% of people are all looking and  think and act the same way with a few minorities who are kind of disempowered. It's better to  think a continent that's so diverse and complex. And there's a need to take into account of China's  diversity when w e try to understand China.  Elaine Fernandez:  In China’s political meritocracy, public officials are selected and promoted based on their ability  to deliver outcomes, and their virtue.  As a result, there is no strict division between civil servants and politicians, meaning that  experienced and effective public officials are often able to rise into positions of leadership.

Catalysing Transformations in Business

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned how the private sector can approach redesigning business models to better address societal challenges.Given the existential crises we face, in part due to the operations of business, the private sector must go beyond complying with regulations to integrate addressing societal and planetary needs into business models.Redesigning business models is not just a necessary component of a sustainable future, it is also an investment opportunity for businesses to position themselves for future success.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Catalysing Transformations in Business  Elaine Fernandez:  The societal redesign humanity needs demands a transformation in the private sector. The  question is, what can a business do to kickstart the transformation? And for that matter, what  can the individuals in a business also do to contribute?  Vivek Pathak, Global Head and Director of Climate Business at the International Finance  Corporation, shares his views on what we require to catalyse transformation and the role of the  individual in facilitating change.  Vivek Pathak:  It's   very   hard   to   tell   someone   who's   just   achieved   middle-income   status   or   upper  middle-income, hey, don't buy this, don't buy that. And I think what we can do is things like, I  think in Hong Kong, if you go into a store and you want a plastic bag, they charge you for it.  So little things like that can drive behaviour, I believe. And I think plastics, and you talked about  plastics earlier, plastics is a great story in many markets where there was very little awareness, I  believe, many years ago. But over time there have been these stories which have come out and  personally I've followed that very, very carefully. Are people today beginning to understand  where all the plastics that we trash go? Most of them go into the oceans. When it goes into the  oceans, it gets into fish, and many of us eat fish, so it gets into our waterways.  Many microplastics are also in the air, so it's having a huge impact on health. And people are  beginning to understand that now, I would hope. So therefore, what I'm actually getting at is  that education is going to play a key role. We need to be getting the stories out there, we need  to get people to understand the impact of their actions. And we need to get this in right from  primary school all the way up, so that it's the kids of today that can also influence the behaviour  of people like us, people in my age group.  So is it happening? Yes, it's happening. I obviously think it needs to happen a lot faster, but I  think you know, better late than never is my view in life. Fundamentally, when you want to work  
for somebody or to work for a firm, you have to make sure that there is some sort of match  between cultures and ambition and what you want to do.  Now, I completely agree we also need to have that kind of people who are willing to go into  institutions and get them to change. But the best way to do it is really you have to be able to  build the business case for it. Why should you do certain things? Build the business case for it.  Don't go out there and say this is the right thing and what you're doing is immoral and your kids  will suffer. You open the FT and the Wall Street Journal, in any magazine today, you hear enough  of that. We really have to put a positive spin to climate and this is what I hope you can convey to  the students that you're going to teach, is that we really need to get climate as a positive story  out there.  There's a lot of fantastic things that have happened across the world in the last 30 years or 20  years in climate. We need to be able to articulate, this is a great business opportunity for the  future. It's a great investment opportunity and I think that's the best way that we're going to be  able to attract more and more capital at scale. I really think that this is such a broad area. It's  right from the energy transition to decarbonising, hard-to-abate sectors to the whole area of  nature-based solutions, biodiversity, recycling, water management, agriculture. So there's just  so many areas.  So I think people have to choose an area where they have a passion. I think that's the single  most important thing. A lot of people come to me for career advice saying, what should I do?  My first answer is, I'm not going to tell you what to do. You need to think about it yourself. The  second thing I tell people is do what you really enjoy. I joined IFC 24 years ago in an area that  was called portfolio management. Everyone was going out and doing new investments, but I  had done that in Thailand when I was in the private sector. I enjoyed it. I was doing a lot of  recovery. I said I enjoy it, I'll do it. At a very young age I went into risk management. Then a lot  of people came and said, why are you getting into risk? It's for older people. But I said no, I  enjoy it, I want to do it. So I've always believed in doing what you want and then you have to  figure out how to contribute.  There's a lot of great climate funds there, which is a fantastic way to contribute. Indonesia has  some great funds who are doing a lot of interesting work in climate. There's a great fund out of  Singapore for circularity, who's doing some great work when it comes to plastics and recycling  and circularity. So it depends on what you want to do. It depends where you want to live. And I  think then you identify an area where you think you can contribute in any small way or big way.  
It doesn't matter. You have to be able to start somewhere. But I think the most important thing  is you have to enjoy what you're doing. You have to have a passion for it.  Elaine Fernandez:  When it comes to solving humanity's greatest challenges, business has a financial, social and  moral obligation to its stakeholders to contribute in meaningful ways towards redesigning  society.   This   starts   with going beyond business as usual and basic compliance to make  sustainability and meeting societal needs an integral part of the business model.

Driving Workforce Formalisation: The CSO Perspective

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Gayathri Vasudevan highlighted the benefits of workforce formalisation and how it can be enacted.The transition to formal employment can be mutually beneficial for employer and employee alike when it extends beyond skills development: helping to provide “adjacencies” such as housing, healthcare, and transportation can transform an organisation's supply chain.Evidence from LabourNet's pilot projects demonstrates that addressing adjacencies can lead to higher retention rates and better overall well-being for workers.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Driving Workforce Formalisation: The CSO Perspective  Host:  In 2023, the International Labour Organisation, or ILO, estimated that 60% of workers earned  their livelihoods in the informal sector. So what is the difference between formal and informal  work?  In essence, formal employment is government regulated and offers job and income security,  working time regulations, holidays, minimum wage as well as health and safety protections.  Whereas informal employment is not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation or  entitlement to social protections like advance notice of dismissal, severance pay and paid  annual or sick leave, according to the ILO.  Its erratic nature and lack of safety nets mean informal workers are more vulnerable to  economic shocks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when 1.6 billion informal  workers were predicted to have lost 60% of their earnings. While governments recognise the  importance of workforce formalisation, they're often ill-equipped to facilitate the transition on  their own.  This is where civil society comes in. Given their connection to society at the grassroots, they're  uniquely positioned to aid where governments cannot in formalising their labour markets. One  example of this is a social enterprise in India called LabourNet, which to date has provided skills  training and access to basic needs for over 1 million people.  Now, you'll hear from Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO of LabourNet, about the areas or what she  calls the 'levers' that need to be addressed to drive workforce formalisation.  Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan:  When India has looked at its labour force, it's looked at it from a single angle, that education will  be the passport towards formalisation. But I think today, with the new education policy, India  also recognises that education needs to come with skill sets. So I would say the next two  decades will see a transformation in terms of how they look at what they mean by skill.  
Does education equal skill? Skill married with education. So there'll be an enormous churn in  terms of what is the definition of it. The policy framework is today looking at it from a single  lens, right? I think the policy will need to look at the adjacencies. So like, housing is an  adjacency, housing is going to be a big lever towards formalisation because the more people  require and ask for better housing, there will be requirements over how does this wage come?  Because there's a rental to be paid.  So it will be a lag lever, but an important lever. Healthcare is an adjacency. Transport is an  adjacency. The faster I come to where the job is required, the better I am able to access more  formal jobs. For example, if I'm in a rural area which is 3,000 kilometres away, how fast do I  reach an area where jobs are there or will it be taken away by somebody?  So these levers we need to see in conjunction with one another. The moment we see it in a  singular manner, we're looking at it in our neighbourhood. Jobs are never in their  neighbourhood and this is historically proven. It's not only India. Job is somewhere else and the  person who needs the job is somewhere else. I think the national education policy needs to be  seen in conjunction with how policies in the other places work out. What I mean by that is  better roads, better transport facilities will result in jobs, more work being provided at the rural  area which could be part of the supply chain. But on the other side it could be just the agri  supply chain or the logistics supply chain where there is a service required.  I also think is one more lever, is the development lever. So the moment there is fund spent for  water, electricity, schools, preschools, healthcare, the huge opening up of work which will  happen in the rural areas. So the urban area has a different problem. It's not an access problem,  but it is the lack of availability population. So if the levers changes to saying I need to provide for  every hundred persons - good healthcare, good education, good water, decent electricity and  sanitation, imagine the jobs which come. So I think one needs to look at how development itself  could be a lever for formal jobs or decent jobs.  Like for housing, we've started providing hostels. In a construction site, we did housing for  about 100 workers and it's still in the pilot stage. So of the 100 workers that we see, we've 85  who've been there for over seven months. Whereas in a normal construction site there's a  three-month rotation. Workers go home every three months. Here because of the quality of  housing, the availability of water as two simple ones and clean toilets, people do not want to  vacate to go back because they may not be able to come back and get the same housing. So in  the same site we have another 400 or so workers.  
So we've looked at the data from our data visibly there and we do see a change there. Similarly,  in the industrial estates we are running about eight temporary hostels and there we looked at  primarily same thing, water availability on time, availability of home as soon as you come into  the city and a tie up with a local provision shop so that credit is available to buy provisions when  you don't have a wage. Your wage comes only after you work for a week or two. So in that  period is there a credit facility with a provision store which enables them to get it. It's about 250  to 300 people. We've been able to demonstrate for the last two years from, in this particular  case, in the industrial estates, we have two and a half years data. So we're able to monitor the  attrition levels, higher retention, et cetera from it.  But this needs to scale up, so we're looking to see how do we scale up to say, 50% of all people  who are working are provided these adjacencies and therefore you have better retention. So  we're able to have a lot of insights from that which should enable us to devise new services to  ensure they get the adjacencies.  Host:  As Dr. Vasudevan puts it, levers are the areas like skills development that must be addressed to  drive workforce formalisation. However, through their experience, LabourNet has recognised  that skills development alone, while essential, is insufficient to nurture effective supply chain  workforces. As a result, it has taken a ground up approach to improving supply chains by  addressing adjacencies.  Adjacencies are the interconnected factors that improve the overall employability and wellbeing  of workers, helping them to thrive in competitive supply chains. Dr. Vasudevan has shared that  addressing adjacencies, like housing, is not just beneficial to informal workers but also to  employers themselves, a view that has been substantiated by data from LabourNet's pilot  projects.

Systems Thinking in AI: Solving for the Right Problem

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong underscored the importance of adopting a systems thinking approach when aiming to solve problems effectively with AI within a broader societal context.Before applying AI, it is important to accurately identify and define the problems that AI is intended to solve, as misalignment can lead to substantial wasted resources and deviations from desired outcomes.Deploying AI requires systems thinking to address the technology’s complex and far-reaching implications so that solutions target the right problems without causing unintended consequences.AI strategies should be continually realigned to reflect the broader systems in which they operate, not just at the technological level but also in terms of how they serve larger community and societal needs.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Systems Thinking in AI: Solving for the Right Problem  Tsubasa Nair:  It’s extremely easy to get caught up in the excitement of the AI hype. But if we take a step back  to see the bigger picture, it’s important that we take a systems - thinking approach regarding AI.  This is because when it comes to a technology with as far - reaching implications and complex  capabilities as AI, the consequences of not precisely targeting the right problems can be  profound.  Let’s now hear from Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed. Dan has been the CEO of an AI - focused business  and has driven and implemented over 30 AI projects at the global transport company, MTR, for  which he was GM of Global Innovation.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he teaches a course on  AI and Product Innovation.  Dan will explore how we can strategically harness AI by applying systems - thinking to solve the  right problems.  Dan Wong:  People often say that we need to solve for the right problem, and this is one of those things that's  very easy to say and extremely hard to do in practice. It's very, very hard to resist the urge to  immediately jump in and in the most efficient and quick w ay, solve the problem at hand. But I  think for a technology like AI, which is a very broad   general - purpose   technology, it's especially  important to take a step back and relook at the problem.  There's a very, very interesting example, which I will call the 'fighter jet' example, that will  illustrate this point. This is from World War Two, and this is a real case.  During World War Two, the allies were looking at their fighter jets and lots of fighter jets were  coming back damaged. And there were clear areas where there were bullet holes and where the  fighter jet sustained damage. And when you see the pictures of the se fighter jets with the
  damage, and this was the first reaction was, hey, we need to very, very quickly fortify the areas  that are being shot, all the areas that have concentration or bullet holes. We need to find a way  to add armouring or plating to make sure that we protect the   planes in the best possible way.  And this is indeed the work and the solution that the corps of engineers were doing. But there  was also a mathematician called Abraham Wald, who said hold on. Maybe there's a different way  to look at this data. And what is   that different way?  Actually, the planes that were able to fly back are the lucky ones. These are the ones that were  able to sustain damage and make it back safely. Actually, the ones that didn't make it back safely  are all the areas where there are no bullet holes. So should n't we look at the data differently?  Shouldn't we   actually be   collecting the data in the areas where there are no bullet holes?  So this illustrated a very important point, which is when we're applying technology, especially  technology like AI, take a step back and look at the broader system level environment. Don't jump  in and start collecting data and analysing the data, which is   a very natural urge that organisations,  individuals and departments directly dive into.  Another very interesting case study comes from the area of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous  driving. And autonomous driving is an area in the domain where AI is used very, very deeply. And  in the domain of autonomous driving and autonomous vehicles, it's ve ry, very easy to focus our  attention on the vehicle. How do we use machine learning in a way to optimise this vehicle? It  could be optimising for individual convenience, getting around and mobility. It could be  optimising for the safety of that individual   driver or passenger of the autonomous vehicle, and  there's nothing wrong with that. But there are different ways to think about it. And if we take a  step back, what are we actually trying to solve for? One level of it, we're solving at the individual  produ ct level.  But autonomous vehicles operate in a broader environment. An autonomous vehicle does not  drive itself in an empty street. It drives in the street with other cars. And some of these other cars  are autonomous vehicles, others are not. And have we thought abo ut in this environment, when  an autonomous vehicle is driving, does it affect the behaviour of non - autonomous vehicles? Who  is simulating that? If that is a problem we're solving for, is it optimising the safety when this  vehicle is actually driving on the   street? Once we add in the complexity of other vehicles on a  street level, then we need to think about this differently. This is what they call going now, then  to a more community level. There's another layer that we think about this as well, which is let 's  go from street level to the city level.
  And there's a topic that's commonly known as smart city. And within a smart city, one of the big  contributors is safe transportation. How do we reduce the traffic congestion in a city, take  vehicles off the road? How do we enhance the safety overall for al l citizens within the city and  even here, really, then analyse that and with a feeling that autonomous vehicles using technology  should be solving all these problems. They should take vehicles off the   road;   it should be safer.  But if you really think about it may not be the case, it could actually be the opposite. There could  actually be more cars on the road.  Here's an example. I used to live in Silicon Valley. They're long distances. I might be driving up  from the Bay Area into the city to attend a meeting, attend a concert. But yet parking in the city  is very expensive. So maybe I'll just have the car drive m e from my home all the way up to the  city, all the way back down, and drive back up and pick me up afterwards. And if we have  collective behaviour like this, we might have the exact opposite result of more congestion and  actually not saving time. Same thin g goes for safety. And in this scenario, if you then think about  this from a system level, from a smart city perspective, maybe the problem to solve for and the  solution is not AI and autonomous vehicles. It's actually better public transport.  And of course, this is something that hits home to me, because I used to be the GM of Innovation  at MTR Corporation, the public transport operator in Hong Kong and eight other cities. What do  we take away from this example and these three levels? There are   two ways to look at it in terms  of how   we think   about solving for the right problem.  Let's pretend you are an autonomous car vehicle company. It is your job to create the solutions.  What this actually tells you is that you can take a step back and maybe your only market is not  just creating the autonomous vehicle, maybe you can, still usin g AI, take another step up and  create a solution at the street level. Take another step up and you're providing a smart city  solution, which could actually be a much bigger business opportunity.  One of the benefits of thinking more system level and we take a step back is when you solve for  the right problem, you're hitting a much bigger opportunity. This is very, very important when  we think about applied technologies like AI.  On the other hand, to the extent that organisations are operating within a broader society, how  do we think about how our organisation works within this broader environment? And there are  multiple factors at play. And once we start thinking about our organ isation in a broader society  environment, we think about the problem to solve in a different way.
  And so there are two pieces here that remind us to think about and consider as we think about  deploying AI as a technology. And this is one of the key opportunities, the key mindsets, the key  capabilities in terms of deploying technology, not just technolo gy like AI, but all technologies.  Tsubasa Nair:  As Dan has shared, It’s important to continuously assess and realign our strategies in relation to  the broader systems in which technologies like AI operate.  When it comes to complex technologies like AI, even a slight misalignment in goals or  understanding can lead to outcomes that diverge significantly from our intended paths.

What are Existential Threats?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about existential threats: risks that can jeopardise the survival of individuals, communities, organisations, or humanity as a whole. Broadly, there are ten existential threats: six environmental crises and four societal shortfalls.The six environmental crises are: pollution, oceanic crisis, freshwater crisis, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and extreme weather.Pollution is the most visible of these crises, impacting air, water, and soil, with severe consequences for both ecosystems and human health.Air pollution, primarily driven by fossil fuel emissions, poses an existential threat as it leads to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths, especially in middle- and low-income countries. It also contributes to global warming, leading to climate-related challenges.Water pollution, resulting from waste, chemicals, and sewage, threatens aquatic life and human health. Over 80% of sewage is released into rivers and oceans without treatment, contributing to child deaths and other health problems, particularly in lower-income countries.Soil pollution, resulting from harmful chemicals and heavy metals introduced into soil, undermines agricultural productivity and food safety. Microplastics have been found in various food types and even in human blood, indicating the widespread impact of soil pollution on human health.Oceans, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, are sensitive to changes in temperature, acidity, and salt levels. Pollution, overfishing, and disruptions to marine ecosystems are causing harm to marine life and the climate-regulating capacity of the oceans.Freshwater resources are depleting rapidly, leading to water scarcity. Increased water demand, receding aquifers, and lack of access to safe drinking water affect communities and ecosystems. Water underpricing in particular contributes to overuse and wastage.Importantly, these environmental crises are interconnected with the global economic model: pollution is a byproduct of economic activity, fish stocks are not effectively managed, and freshwater is underpriced.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  What are Existential Threats?  Rohan Hazell:  In the last module, we examined the drivers of change shaping the 21st century. Now, we're  going to explore the next component of the redesigning society framework: existential threats.  Existential threats are risks that have the potential to jeopardise the survival of individuals,  communities,   organisations,   or   even   humanity   as   a whole. Today, there are many such  challenges that call for our attention, and it can be hard to know which to prioritise. However, a  systematic review of existing efforts to redesign society– from the UN Sustainable Development  Goals to frontline work by civil society organisations– reveals that humanity's problems can be  categorised into ten existential threats.  Six of them fall under the category of "environmental crises", namely: pollution, oceanic crisis,  freshwater crisis, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and extreme weather. The other four are  societal shortfalls, including lack of access to basic needs, epidemics and pandemics, conflict,  and wide scale societal traumas (such as the global decline in mental health and well being).  Across this module, we'll introduce all ten, starting with the most visible environmental crisis:  pollution.  Pollution  All of us have had some experience with pollution. It's one of the most visible environmental  crises. From plastic bags on the street, to haze in the air, to oil spills in the ocean. But it's the  pollution we don't see that poses the greatest existential risk. And there are three main types:  air, water, and soil pollution.  Air pollution, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, emits toxic substances that damage  human and ecosystem health alike. In 2022, the World Health Organization announced that  almost the entire global population no longer breathes good quality air, resulting in respiratory  diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths.  
In fact, air pollution is responsible for over 7 million premature deaths every year, almost all of  which occur in middle- and low-income countries. Additionally, the emission of greenhouse  gases like carbon dioxide Accelerates global warming, leading to erratic climate patterns, rising  sea levels and extreme weather events. This can disrupt agriculture, threaten food security,  trigger mass migration, and even intensify societal tensions and conflicts. For this reason, air  pollution has been called the "largest existential threat" by Lancet Planetary Health, a leading  scientific journey.  The   second   type   of   pollution   is   water   pollution.   When   waste   and   chemicals   from  manufacturing,   agriculture,   or   sewage   contaminate   freshwater   sources,   aquatic   life   is  immediately placed at risk. There are about 350,000 different types of artificial chemicals in the  global market, but the environmental impact of these chemicals on aquatic plants, animals, and  microbes remains largely unknown.  Serious health risks also arise for humans who rely on these sources for drinking and sanitation.  Again, we often don't see the full impact of this, but studies have shown that over 80 percent of  sewage generated by human activities is released into rivers and oceans without any treatment.  As a result, 50 percent of child deaths worldwide are related to poor water quality, and most of  these occur in low-income countries.  Then we have soil pollution. The introduction of harmful chemicals and heavy metals into soil  are widely known to undermine agricultural productivity and food safety. In the long term, this  depletes soil fertility. And can lead to the accumulation of toxins in the food chain, endangering  human and animal health.  For example, a study in 2022 discovered that microplastics can now be found in many different  food types, and have even worked their way into human blood. In summary, the cumulative  impact of pollution is not confined by national borders; it affects every corner of the globe, and  contributes to other existential threats, like oceanic and freshwater crisis, which we'll look at  next.  Oceanic Crises  The second environmental crisis involves oceans. Over 70 percent of the Earth is covered by  water, so it's tempting to think that the oceans are safe from human activity. But the reality is  that ocean ecosystems are sensitive to even small changes in temperature, acidity, or salt levels.  And we're already causing these to fluctuate more than usual.  
As mentioned previously, pollution plays a big role here. As fishing nets, chemicals, and plastic  cause huge amounts of damage to marine life. You may have heard of the Great Pacific Garbage  Patch, a 1.6 million square kilometre collection of waste that is three times the size of France.  There are two other points to consider. The first is overfishing.  According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, 90 percent of the world's fish  stocks are being depleted far faster than they can be replenished. The challenge here is that fish  in the open ocean are seen as common goods, meaning that everyone has access to them. This  means there are very few global governance systems in place to effectively manage overfishing.  These critical resources that have sustained us for millennia are often out of sight, out of mind.  The second point to consider is that oceans are one of the planet's greatest defences against  climate change.  Seawater and marine ecosystems help regulate the climate year-round, and by disrupting them,  we risk more than coral bleaching and depleted fisheries. These disruptions are beginning to  cause unmanageable sea level rise and extreme weather events. Failing to address these  challenges not only jeopardises the health of oceans, but also threatens human health and  safety by undermining food security, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and  displacing vulnerable coastal populations.  Freshwater Crises  Continuing with the theme of water, the next environmental existential threat to examine  concerns freshwater. It may surprise you to know that only 3 percent of the total water on the  planet is freshwater, and just 1 percent of that freshwater is easily accessible for human use.  Despite how limited supplies are, we're still depleting freshwater resources at an alarming rate,  which brings us to the first point for consideration, water scarcity.  According to the World Resources Institute, over the last 50 years, water demand has increased  by 250%. A study led by NASA revealed that societies across the world are consuming fresh  water at a rate faster than it can be replenished. 21 out of the world's 37 major aquifers which  are underground stores of freshwater are receding. Despite this, around 1.6 billion people  worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water, a critical resource that plays a vital role in the  health, [00:09:00] livelihoods, and food security of poor communities. This is such a significant  challenge that it can keep entire communities locked in poverty for generations.  Water scarcity also impacts land-based ecosystems and puts them at risk of collapse as we  gradually expand the size of our cities and continue to build infrastructure on rivers, like dams,  docks, and bridges. Large and small scale agribusinesses also suffer from freshwater scarcity.  
Without large amounts of freshwater, we simply can't grow food. It's for this reason that  agriculture accounts for 92% of humanity's fresh water use.  Perhaps the most concerning part of this is that water is almost universally underpriced for such  a   valuable   and   scarce   resource   industry   and   residential   communities   alike   are   charged  shockingly little for it, leading to overuse and wastage. Calculations by the International  Monetary Fund suggest that this results in governments paying over $456 billion in subsidies to  make up for underpayment by people and businesses.  Summary  In this chapter, we've covered the first three environmental crises. Now, one of the key lessons  from studying these existential threats is the fact that they are inextricably linked to our global  economic model. Pollution is a byproduct of economic activity, fish stocks are not considered or  managed as a finite resource and freshwater is underpriced.  In the next chapter, we'll explore the final three environmental crises: biodiversity loss, land  degradation, and extreme weather.

The Intersection of Business and Government

### keyTakeaway
This chapter emphasises the two-way relationship between government and business, and how the dynamic interaction between these two sectors co-creates much of our economic activity.Effective wealth redistribution by the government is crucial to prevent wealth concentration at the top and to maintain societal stability and prosperity.Businesses contribute to wealth redistribution primarily through taxes, which fund essential public services and infrastructure necessary for societal wellbeing and business success.The government sets rules and regulations for businesses, and invests in them, debunking the misconception of government as a business hindrance and highlighting its role in creating conducive conditions for business and societal wellbeing.The privatisation of healthcare and other essential services has led to disparities and challenges, raising questions about the extent and impact of privatisation on public access to basic human rights.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Intersection of Business and Government  Elaine Fernandez:  The relationship between the public and private sectors is often seen as tense. But the reality is,  both are deeply dependent on the other. You'll hear from Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the  Global Institute for Tomorrow, on the importance of taxation and business' role in contributing  to public coffers, as well as how public policy can guide business development at a high level.  Eric Stryson:  Without effective mechanisms for wealth redistribution, we will have a situation where more  and more of the wealth is consolidated at the very narrow top of the pyramid. And this creates,  again, tensions in society and erodes those foundations of stability and prosperity. Sometimes  government does this very effectively in terms of wealth redistribution. Sometimes it does it  poorly. But we should not assume that business will redistribute wealth on its own. And if you  just look at the narrow band of those who own shares in companies, it's obvious that business  will not, on its own, redistribute wealth sufficiently. That is certainly a role for the government.  And the primary way that business redistributes wealth in society is through taxes. Taxes are  one of those social obligations of a business. It provides funds for public services. It helps to  underwrite the infrastructure necessary for modern life, and indeed the infrastructure which is  necessary for business success and societal wellbeing. Without tax revenues, the government is  not   able   to   provide   everything   from the roads, the water and sewerage networks, the  electricity, the backbone of the internet and communications technology.  And even we should remember that an educated and healthy workforce is essential to business  success. Imagine if you were to try to run your business without a healthy workforce, without  an educated workforce, you really wouldn't get very far. And those public services are provided  by the government and funded in large part by tax revenue. So therefore, that kind of wealth  redistribution in society is essential, and paying taxes is very much a social obligation of a  business.  
So another point to remember about business is it's not in the nature of business itself to limit  itself. In a way, if business had no rules and regulations, it would continue doing what it does  without limit. Public policy, which is set by the government, is what aims to manage and protect  the best interests of society. And too often I feel that the government is perceived as an enemy  of business, and something which we just need to get out of the way for business to thrive and  for it to succeed. I think we need to really rethink and reset our understanding of the  relationship   between   government   and   business,   and understand that companies do not  self-regulate themselves. It is the government which sets the rules and the regulations that  business must follow.  And so we need to also find new ways of valuing, accepting and understanding the real value of  regulation in society, which is to protect the best interests of the public. Again, the conventional  narrative is that government is inefficient, it's troublesome, and we too often discount the  essential role that government plays in laying the foundations for business success and societal  wellbeing.   It   is   the   government   that   provides   the   core   infrastructure,   supports   health,  education, and invests in core R&D. All of these things are critical for business success.  I think one of the best illustrations of this is the internet and our modern communications  infrastructure, which was developed alongside GPS and many of our other technologies that we  use in modern business, was developed by the state. That core R&D was invested, it was  developed using public funding and the further applications of the internet and our whole  digital economy has become a backbone, in many ways, for new industries and for how modern  business has evolved.  We should also not forget, during the pandemic, the government is everything. I mean, the  government's ability to manage public health, to provide access to medical services, to set rules  that guide individuals, to keep people healthy and safe, that is done by the government, it's not  done by private enterprise. So the government's role, remember the pillars of a well-functioning  society. The government's pillar role is to balance the collective well being with economic  development and the opportunities for private business to thrive. There is a need to balance  public goods and private profit in society. To do this, the government has learned that some  services are delivered more effectively and more efficiently by private operators. And so it is up  to the government to make those decisions of what should and what should not be privatised.  I think today we see a great dilemma in many of the services which we rely on, again, to live a  high quality of life being privatised in different parts of the world. Clearly, healthcare and the  privatisation of health services has caused big problems through the pandemic, both in the  
United States, in the UK and in many parts of the Western world. It caused problems because  private operators of healthcare were not inclined to stockpile protective equipment. They are  not predisposed to preparing for the emergency, unexpected situations. It's not profitable to do  so. So it is the government which needs to prepare for these unexpected events. Furthermore,  the privatisation of healthcare creates a polarisation and a stratification in society whereby you  have high quality of health services to those who can pay and the bare minimum or no access at  all for those who cannot pay.  And this, we have to ask how this can exist in a society understanding that health is a basic  human right. There are other examples of privatisation of essential services, like privatisation of  water, which has really mixed results. In some societies it has led to improved access and  improved expansion of access to water. But in other societies, particularly in Colombia and  other parts of South America, it has led to great problems and great backlash in society because  citizens feel that their basic right to water has been monetised and put out of reach.  So do our notions of public and private access to resources require us to rethink and reset our  understanding? Have we gone too far down the road of privatising basic services such that  many within society have been left out?  Elaine Fernandez:  From regulation and incentives to infrastructure and law enforcement, the government's role is  to   create   the   conditions   for   business   to   flourish   without   compromising   societal   and  environmental wellbeing. It's also important to remember that when businesses are responsible  about their obligations to the state, such as paying tax, they better enable governments to  improve national conditions through the provision of public goods. The private sector may also  deliver public goods, but the profit motive means segments of society may be left underserved,  which is why governments make the final decision on the public goods that should be  privatised. If they don't, consumers and businesses alike may suffer.  For these reasons, the public and private sectors shouldn't be seen as opponents, but rather as  collaborators that co-create the conditions of modern societies and economies.

 Purpose: The Social and Public Spheres

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about igniting a sense of purpose in the social and public spheres of life, and how aligning your sense of purpose with a higher mission can ultimately contribute to positive change and resilience in times of adversity. Purpose in the social sphere is influenced by and influences our communities, from local neighbourhoods to shared interests with peers. It highlights the role everyone plays in redesigning society, often starting with local efforts. In the public sphere, individuals often derive purpose from addressing major social, environmental, and economic issues, requiring knowledge, communication, and empathy. Articulating your purpose is essential when aspiring to play a role in redesigning society, as it provides a guiding anchor for sustained efforts and impact. For example, clarity of purpose is crucial when dealing with contentious positions and resistance from stakeholders. As articulated by Mr Feike Sijbesma, former CEO of DSM, one’s impact on society and contributions to the world are often more memorable than financial success in one's personal or professional life. Society values contributions that benefit people today and future generations. Purpose is dynamic and evolves over time, requiring periodic reflection and recalibration. You can use the Purpose Mapping tool to help you clarify and align your personal and professional purpose with these other spheres.

TRANSCRIPT  Purpose: The Social and Public Spheres  Rohan Hazell:  Our purpose in the social sphere shapes and is shaped by our communities. This could be your  local neighbourhood, kids' school or sports team, people bound by shared interests and  hobbies, or a vulnerable group in need of support who you are committed to serving. The  impact we can each have on our local communities is a reminder that everyone has a role to  play in redesigning society, and it often starts very close to home.  Daniel Bercasio:  When we talk about scale, in our experience, it is also a consequence of our push to create a  movement, not just nationwide, but around these small communities. So scale is not just a  target. "Hey, we want to reach 10,000 communities by this year." But actually, scale is a  consequence of building that movement of Filipinos and friends of Filipinos who also want to  have their own personal transformation story.  Going back to the point of how we can make it personal, it goes beyond me as Dan Bercasio. It  is also important and actually more challenging how to engage your family. So for many of us,  we start as individuals, but eventually now become a story of a family. Our own family helps,  making sure that we hope to create a different history for our country.  Now for us here in the Philippines, especially at this point wherein we are going through not just  poverty, but also the pandemic and now a looming food crisis because of Ukraine, because of  fuel prices going up. So this is a unique history, a unique point in our history. So our question for  us is, especially with our volunteers, will we just allow history to dictate our story or we will  proactively write a better history for our country.  Rohan Hazell:  In this sphere, the focus expands to our desire and capacity to affect change around the big  social, environmental, and economic issues we feel passionately about. Whether it be education  
or climate change, poverty or politics. Our efforts within this sphere are directed toward having  a broader impact on the world around us.  Bringing about change in the public sphere requires courage and perseverance, along with  knowledge, communication, and empathy. We may need to hold positions that are contentious,  say things that are unpopular, and deal with dissatisfaction or resistance from stakeholders.  Knowing our purpose for taking a stance and calling for change provides us with an anchor we  can return to again and again.  If we have aspirations to play a role in redesigning society by taking on larger social issues,  taking the time to articulate our purpose is crucial to ensuring we stay the course.  Feike Sijbesma:  Starting a company, managing a company, spending your life, a large part of your life to that.  And of course you need to have the right financial returns, otherwise you will not operate. A  company is not a philanthropic organisation. It's not a charity foundation. You need to have  economic successes. Most people will forget the economic successes.  They will remember how you contributed to society, how you contributed to this world, et  cetera. That is what people will remember about you. If that is what people will remember,  society found that one apparently more important than the exact financial numbers, because  they will remember what they found the most important.  And that tells you enough where to focus on. And I'm not saying that you should not have any  financial returns, because you are not a charity, you are not a philanthropic organisation so you  need to have financial returns. But you will not be remembered for those financial returns. You  will be remembered when you contribute to society. And think about that. That basically we all  work to the benefit of people today and generations to come, and we should remember that  and work like that.  Rohan Hazell:  Clarity of purpose, whether in your personal life, community work or society at large is essential  to redesigning society. Use the purpose mapping tool to reflect, clarify and articulate where  your sense of purpose comes from in the four spheres we covered earlier. Notice any recurring  
themes, and in particular, any connections that provide opportunities to align your personal and  professional purpose with the other two spheres.  Remember, purpose is not static. It is dynamic and constantly evolving, just like you. Come back  to the purpose mapping tool whenever you feel the need to refresh and recalibrate your sense  of purpose, whether during times of transition, in the face of big decisions or challenges, or just  because a year has passed since you last did the exercise.  Throughout this series, we have explored the collective challenges we face and the root causes  of the existential threats facing humanity. Accepting the state of the world and how we got here  does not mean passive resignation. On the contrary, acceptance means active recognition that  things are the way they are.  This is crucial, because without knowing where we stand, we cannot take the first step toward  positive change. It also means acknowledging that in each challenge lies an opportunity to  redesign our societies for the better. Keep this in mind as you explore the GIFT.ed platform,  which having completed this series, you can now do so freely.  We encourage you to dive into new topics with an open mind and a willingness to challenge the  status quo and question conventional wisdom on how we move forward. Whilst doing so, you  can engage with other learners from different countries and backgrounds, broaden your  worldview, and raise your awareness around the most important topics of our time.

TRANSCRIPT  The World Today  Rohan Hazell:  In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair describes the defining features of the world  today, and how they are inseparable from globalisation as we know it.  Chandran Nair:  Let me take a couple of minutes to talk about the world today. What we do know is that the  population of the world is about 8 billion. We also do know that we are fascinated by what we  call the Digital Age. Everything we refer to, the way we comfort ourselves about human progress  today is by reference to the great advances of the Digital Age.  But I ask you all to think a bit more about the world today. A population of 8 billion living during  a period of exponential rise in carbon emissions. What does a world in which uncontrolled  carbon emissions are allowed to essentially change the very nature of how human beings live  and the impact it'll have on everything from the food we eat right through to the places we live  in and the way we travel or the way we essentially build our homes.  Yet at the same time, newly rich countries in today's world have a right to resources. And by  virtue of that, they're also putting increasing pressure on these resources globally.  The digital age itself is putting huge amounts of pressure and creating even geopolitical tensions  by virtue of its thirst for resources, particularly things like rare metals and rare earths that go  into many of the products and things that we consume in terms of the digital devices that we  are so reliant on.  The world today is also one in which the US and China tensions are now at a whole time high.  We all see and fear what might happen. The hope is that good sense will prevail, and China-US  tensions will not boil over into war, which will engulf other countries, and, but at the same time,  it does demand other countries to decide how do they navigate this very complex tension  between the two superpowers?  The global pandemic has essentially been a game changer. It has hopefully also taught human  beings of the need to essentially live within constraints. It will also require us to invest heavily in  
the world today in understanding economic activities, but at the same time, making sure that  the external impacts do not create vulnerabilities to societies will, we’ll need to invest heavily in  healthcare systems, but also in water and sanitation system to essentially enhance hygiene  conditions for the majority of the world. That's the world today.  It's also the hottest decade since records were kept. If you've been looking at events in 2022,  you will notice that a country like Pakistan has had the most severe floods in its history. One  third of this large nation is underwater. One third. Many of us didn't realise that Pakistan is  actually home to 7,000 glaciers. Many of these glaciers are melting at rates that no one had  anticipated partly due to rising temperatures, high rainfalls and a host of other impacts  associated with a growing population in Pakistan.  China has had its most crippling droughts to the extent that it has even had to curb its  hydroelectric schemes and now agriculture in many parts of China are also under threat  because the rainfalls, the rain that's needed for the first plantings have not been realised. So,  throughout the world this is happening in Europe, we have seen large scale fires in North  America, Canada, et cetera.  So, the world today is characterised by what this company called the Digital Age or the  Industrial Revolution, 4.0, it's an overdrive. But what I ask you all to think about as you think  about these issues is what does that overdrive actually mean? Is it a net positive? Is it  something that we will have to leverage in ways that creates a greater balance in terms of the  challenges we face, and particularly in terms of dealing with the existential threats?  Rohan Hazell:  The outcomes of globalisation have helped to define modern day progress, from healthcare  advancements   that   have   allowed   the   human   population   to   increase,   to   geopolitical  relationships that foster trade and cultural exchange.  But it’s also resulted in large-scale and deeply interconnected challenges. It’s important to bear  in mind that while globalisation will continue in one form or another, we should be mindful of  which aspects of globalisation are most beneficial to our countries and organisations.

Managing Pandemics: Improving Healthcare Provision

### keyTakeaway
Improving healthcare provision to manage pandemics requires investment in public health "software" (education, awareness, and research) and "hardware" (physical infrastructure like hospitals and sanitation).Education regarding hygiene and professional training for healthcare workers, are crucial for early detection, prevention, and containment of pandemics, benefiting society at large.Investing in public health infrastructure, including clean water access and hospital care, is essential to prevent outbreaks and ensure equitable healthcare access.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Managing Pandemics: Improving Healthcare Provision  Rohan Hazell:  The good news is that all communicable diseases are at some level preventable from reaching  epidemic or pandemic stages. This is why societies and governments should focus on  developing robust mitigation approaches, starting with investment into public hea lth  infrastructure.  This is a very broad area for development. So, to break it down, we will focus on what we will  call the “software” and the “hardware” of healthcare provision. By software, we mean the  non - material medical assets of a healthcare system, such as raising awar eness, education,  and research. On the other hand, hardware refers to physical public health infrastructure like  hospitals, water supply and sanitation.  For software, the first major area to consider is community education and raising awareness  on water, sanitation, and hygiene, or WASH as it's referred to. WASH is the foundation for a  healthy society. When people, and particularly children get educated on   washing their hands  after using the toilet or blowing their nose, or knowing which water sources they should and  shouldn't drink from, then pathogens have a much smaller chance of spreading.  This is particularly important in poorer communities and low - income countries where access  to hand washing facilities can be limited, and water can become contaminated. But this also  applies to high income countries too. Studies show that over 50% of peopl e will consider not  washing their hands if the nearest sink is over eight meters away.  So, regardless of where you are in the world, there is a need to create behavioural change to  make hand washing more regular. There are solutions to this challenge. GIFT worked with a  Cambodian - based healthcare organisation called Happy Tap, which aims at   providing low -  cost, portable hand washing facilities that can be placed at easily accessible spots for children,  teachers, and even doctors. Their approach was so successful that over the pandemic, the  British government began recommending their product to   schools across the UK.  The second area is professional education. Healthcare professionals with up - to - date training  in   infectious diseases can help with surveillance to detect and contain potential outbreaks  before they even occur. Equally, they can provide effective treatment for infected individuals,  and can contribute to prevention strategies that reduce the spread of   pathogens. Because  epidemics   and   pandemics   impact   large   numbers   of   people,   they   can   also   support
  governments   with   effective   public   health   messaging,   providing   accurate   and   timely  information on disease transmission and treatments for the public. This can help to also  combat misinformation.  An educated healthcare workforce is also instrumental for research and development into  diagnosis and testing to help identify the root causes that lead to a particular pathogen  spreading. Data like this is vital to set up preventative measures. Healthcare   professionals also  contribute to the production of new medicines and vaccines. We saw during the COVID - 19  pandemic how accelerated vaccine production helped to curb the mortality rate of the  disease.  According to the Centre for Disease Control and Protection in the US, vaccinated individuals  are 15 times less likely to die from Covid infections. However, COVID - 19 vaccines were not  without their side effects and suspicions, which is why research and dev elopment into  vaccinations and their side effects should be prioritised and communicated clearly with the  public, so greater trust can be earned for the technologies governments recommend to  mitigate   the   impacts   of   widespread   communicable   diseases.   This   sh ould   not   be  underestimated. Trust is the currency of gaining society wide buy - in during a time of crisis.  In order to mitigate the likelihood of a pandemic occurring in future, we cannot rely solely on  the latest technologies. Perhaps more importantly, we will need the basic technologies. And  this brings us to the “hardware” of public healthcare.  First and foremost is improving living standards through decent housing that has access to  clean water and effective sanitation systems. Prevention is better than cure, and without  access to clean water and safe disposal of waste, infectious diseases are m uch more likely to  spread, such as cholera and typhoid.  According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.7 billion people still do not have basic  sanitation services. Yet, this is one of the most worthwhile urban planning investments that  governments and businesses can make to benefit society. With every $1 i nvested into  sanitation, there is a return of nearly $6 in lower health costs, more productivity, and fewer  premature deaths.  The second aspect of essential hardware is the provision of hospital or clinic care. According  to the Organisation for Economic Corporation and Development, Japan and South Korea  stand out as international leaders, with 13 and 12.4 hospital beds per thousa nd people  respectively, while low - income countries tend to have fewer. India for example, has just 0.5.  But the reality is, fewer countries have this basic need properly addressed. Even in high  income countries like the US and the UK, they have just 2.9 an d 2.5 hospital beds per thousand  people, despite massive government budgets for providing public healthcare.
  Healthcare facilities should also be affordable and equipped with ambulance services that can  access as many communities as possible. This is naturally a challenge, especially for low -  income countries and rural communities, but it is essential to ensure th at poor communities  can benefit from public healthcare. Without equitable access, epidemics and pandemics are  very likely to impact these communities more.  Improving healthcare provision is clearly the first step to mitigating the rise of new  communicable diseases. A two - pronged approach can be taken, which focuses government  investment and business activities on both developing software and hardware. This wi ll  ensure   that   hospitals   are   built,   medical   workforces   are   educated,   and   supporting  infrastructure like water supply and sanitation are put in place.

Redesigning the Economy: Resistance to Change

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Jayati Ghosh emphasised the human origin of the economy, challenging the perception that economic systems are inevitable forces. She urged a shift in mindset, asserting that society has the power to shape and reform the economy for the greater good. Human choices, rather than rigid economic laws, determine the form and function of the economy. However, there is resistance to change, primarily from those benefiting from the existing system - large capital owners like corporations and wealthy individuals - highlighting the need for global regulation to improve wealth distribution. Mobilisation of citizens is vital to hold governments accountable and demand equality in areas like taxation and knowledge sharing.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning the Economy: Resistance to Change  Rohan Hazell:  The   globalisation   of   financial   systems   and   technological   advancements   have   created  unprecedented opportunities for trade and economic activity between nations.  Various multilateral organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and  the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation, were founded to recommend  policies, stimulate economic trade, and facilitate the economic development   of countries within  these systems.  While multilateral cooperation has played a role in enabling many developing countries to grow  their economies, this has not come without a cost.  Jayati Ghosh is a Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a member  of the UN Secretary General’s High - Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, and the  WHO’s Council on the Economics of Health for All.  Professor Ghosh guides us on an exploration of the ways in which multilateral trade and financial  systems have shaped the global economy and the development of nations. She also offers her  expert insights on overcoming resistance to redesigning our economi es for the better.  Prof. Jayathi Gosh:  We have to remember first of all that the economy is a human construct. It isn't something given  to us from nature. It is something that human beings created, evolved through societies in  different forms, and that whatever form of economy we choose, it's o ur choice.  That's something that is very hard to get across because people seem to think that it is this  inexorable thing that is coming down on them, and they have no real choice or agency in this  matter. We've come to a point where constantly we are told that you h ave to do this because  there is no alternative, the economy requires it. There are these rigid economic laws that are  going to force you to behave in a certain way, and you have to adjust to that. So we are always  told, for example, that austerity is neces sary because of the economy, or you have to cope with
  very volatile capital flows which might cause a financial crisis in your own economy and cause  you to lose your livelihood because of the economic laws. That's actually not true.  The economy is a human construct, and that means it can be shaped and changed, and the rules  by which it operates can be altered by humans, by societies. And we need to think of making the  economy work for us, for people, for society, for a just humane sus tainable society. Instead of  thinking what we have to do to conform to these requirements of this economy, we have to say,  well, we have economic arrangements. How do we change those arrangements so as to enable  the greater good of all? So as to enable lif e on this planet, to enable us to avoid   extreme  ecological destruction?  These are now obvious questions because we are facing these existential threats on the planet  and for humanity. We are facing extreme inequality of wealth, of incomes, of opportunities, and  we are getting social tensions and political upheavals that come o ut of such inequalities.  So obviously we have to do something. What does that mean?  It means that we must create a framework for the economy to function, which does not  necessarily privilege those who are already wealthy, those who hold capital, and those who can  thereby influence governments to make those rules and regulations in their o wn favour. We have  to have a more democratic framing of laws, rules, regulations, which gives greater opportunities  for all, which ensures a more equitable sharing of the economic pie, and which does not stifle the  growth of small, micro, medium enterprise s of individuals who are self - employed and of those  who are working for wages for a living.  The most obvious resistance to this change is from those who benefit from it currently. That is to  say, who benefits? Large capital benefits. Very wealthy people benefit. Let me give you an  example.  Multinationals pay effective tax rates, which are tiny, which are less than 10% of their profits,  whereas domestic employers and firms end up paying whatever is their national tax rate, which  is usually 20% and above. And they can do that because they're u sing existing rules.  Those rules can be changed. We can opt for a system of global, unitary taxation that forces  multinational companies to pay the same as all other companies. But those rules are being  thwarted at the international negotiating level by governments that are un der the sway of their  own multinational corporations, by their corporate lobbies. So it's power that is determining this.
  Similarly, with high - net - worth individuals, we could implement rules for having a global asset  register, where you share information about who owns what, where, who is the beneficiary  owner of a lot of this wealth, which is hidden, secreted away in trusts   that are secret. We could  do this. It's quite simple. It just requires a change in regulation.  Why is that not happening? Because of the power of rich individuals to affect government policy.  So essentially, the reason we're not getting change is because of the power of large corporations,  of rich people who are benefiting from this current state of   affairs, when everyone else is not.  How do we address that power with the countervailing power of people? In other words, we  have to have enormous popular mobilisation. We have to make it impossible for governments to  ignore that voice. We have to force governments to respond to very legitim ate demands of, let  us say, equal rates of taxation. I'm not even saying higher, but equal rates of taxation for the very  rich compared to others, because currently they avoid and escape a lot of those taxes.  We have to demand, for example, that knowledge, which is publicly assisted and supported, and  the creation of knowledge which is done with public subsidies, should be shared with the public,  should be shared with others.  So, for example, at the moment, the TRIPS agreement, the Treaty on Trade - Related Intellectual  Property Rights, which is part of the WTO set of agreements that enables companies to hold  patents and other intellectual property, which makes them monopolise th e knowledge.  So in the COVID - 19 pandemic, we saw that pharma companies benefited hugely from many  different subsidies. At least 12 billion in terms of R&D subsidies to promote research into  vaccines. The US government alone gave more than $6 billion. Moderna got around   $2 billion.  Pfizer, which basically has the other mRNA vaccine, used the technology created by BioNTech,  which got nearly 500 billion Euros from 500 million Euros from the German government.  So, all of these companies have benefited from public support. This is taxpayer money, and yet  they are allowed to hold onto patents that make them restrict their knowledge. So, other  companies cannot produce this. They get the monopoly controlled, they se t prices, they  overcharge governments across the world for the technology that governments help them to  create. And we allow them to do this.
  This benefits no one except big pharma. So, why do we allow it? Because of the lobbying power  of big pharma. Once again, we need the lobbying power of people to counterbalance this. And  so we really have to have much greater awareness of what's going on, m uch greater mobilisation,  much greater popular resistance to such policies.  Rohan Hazell:  Viewing the economy as a human construct opens possibilities to reimagine and redesign it to  serve the majority. But first, we must understand the rights we have as citizens and taxpayers,  and the role we can therefore play, collectively, to influence poli cy decisions.

The Sustainable Business: Adapting to Change 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the rapidly evolving business environment and how businesses must adapt to remain competitive and relevant.Making sustainability a reality requires taking a long-term view and transforming organisations according to society’s shifting needs and the constraints of the 21st century.Balancing foresight and the ability to evolve as the business landscape changes is therefore not just a strategic advantage but a prerequisite for business to build internal resilience and thrive.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Sustainable Business: Adapting to Change  Elaine Fernandez:  With sustainability increasingly taking centre stage in the global agenda, society's expectations  of the private sector are changing and business must learn to adapt or risk becoming irrelevant.  But in a world where our understanding of factors like climate change is constantly being  updated, how can business adaptation keep up?  To give us a better understanding, let's hear from Richard Lancaster, Executive Director and  former Chief Executive Officer of CLP holdings, one of the largest private power producers in the  Asia-Pacific region. Drawing on 35 years in the power industry and in other industrial operations  in Asia, Australia and the United Kingdom, Richard explains why sustainability needs to be  integrated into all business activities and how this can be achieved.  Richard Lancaster:  I think the concept of sustainability obviously brings a very long term view. Businesses and  societies evolve and change. And if you're not adapting and changing in line with society's  expectations,   then   you   become,   over   time,   irrelevant and therefore not sustainable. So  sustainability is all about change and it's all about adapting and being sensitive to the needs and  the requirements of society. So there's an element there of understanding stakeholders,  understanding what they want. It's an element there of managing change and adapting within  your organisation and maintaining relevance. And if you do that, you will continue to have a  business which is serving a purpose, it's meeting the needs of society and is therefore  sustainable.  I think there's a lot of confusion about sustainability. There's a lot of terms that come up,  whether it's CSR or ESG, and a lot of those have connotations with reporting. And many people  think that sustainability is all about reporting and telling people what you're doing. That is part  of it. I think if you are serious about sustainability, it is about understanding requirements, it's  about setting objectives, it's about having plans to achieve those objectives. And it's about  reporting progress so that you're keeping stakeholders informed about your business. So  sustainability is a lot of things. It has so many interactions with so many parts of your business  that therefore it has to be integrated. It has to be just something that becomes part of your  
normal way of doing things, whether you're preparing your financial statements, your annual  reports.  Sustainability   has to be there at the forefront because you're communicating with your  shareholders and stakeholders generally. So building sustainability into that, it has to be part of  your strategy. It has to be part of your business plans. Otherwise you're not setting targets  appropriately, you're not hitting those targets, you're not measuring progress. So for that  reason, I think sustainability just has to be a part of the way you do business.  I think there is an element that expectations have been changing more rapidly. There is more  information available, for one thing, and society is understanding issues more quickly. If I look at  the big issue facing the energy industry, it's climate change. We took a long time to realise that  burning fossil fuels has a detrimental effect on the planet. It took, actually, it took more than a  century for us to realise that. Once we did, we were able to respond quite quickly. It took some  time for the industry to change its way of thinking, to develop alternatives, but we have actually  responded relatively quickly in the last 20 years compared to the first hundred years of our  industry. So I think that pace of change, that's just one example, but there is more information,  there's a better understanding of science, there's more innovation, there's more technology  development that enables solutions. And therefore, not only can we realise more quickly that  we need to change, but we can adapt as an industry and as a business.  We first approached it from the point of view of risk. And risk is something that every business  needs to manage well. And climate change came to us as a risk. We were very heavily invested  in coal. We operate in the Asia-Pacific area. Most of the electricity generation was produced by  coal and that was really the backbone of our business. So if you think about it from a risk  perspective, you're heavily invested in something which potentially is an issue that could put  you out of business. So you need to make some changes and you need to make some changes  early.  We recognise that as far back as 2007, and the first step we took was to engage our  stakeholders. We recognised that we were making quite a significant change to our business.  We needed to explain to our shareholders. We needed to explain to our regulators. We need to  make sure that we were aligned with government policy and the areas that we were operating.  We need to explain to our customers. And so it was that communication that really was  important.   And   I   think   that   was   the   most   crucial   step   we   took,   was   to   undertake   a  communication programme to really create alignment around the change in our business.  
Initially we had to take some bold assumptions around technology that would help us achieve  our decarbonisation target.  Back in 2007, we were aligning ourselves with the IPCC. Science-based, they weren't called  science-based targets in those days, but basically the broad principle was if we worked in line  with the way the entire industry had to achieve a decarbonisation pathway, then that was the  right pace for us. We at that time couldn't see how we would get there. We had to take some  bold assumptions to say along the way, we will learn things, we will change, we will adapt, we  will find ways of doing this. So in many respects, it was an ambition that we were outlining.  Now, we didn't foresee the pace of innovation and cost reduction in renewable energy, for  example. That happened at an exponential pace. We couldn't foresee that at that time, but we  took advantage of that. So as we gained experience, we were able to say, ah, here is a big part  of the solution that we can now see fits into that decarbonisation pathway. The science of the  IPCC has evolved as well. What was a very broad target is now much more precisely defined. It  is a much sharper decline than we expected. So we've had to adjust our targets and our interim  targets as well. So setting out a plan that in 2007, we were talking about a 43 year timeframe to  2050. We're now talking about a 30 year timeframe. It is a much more urgent task for us, but we  know a lot more along that journey.  So evolving our targets and communicating has been really important. Initially we said it would  be at least every five years. We have actually never made it to five years because there's been  so much change, so much acceleration. And even last year, when we published our latest  iteration of our climate vision, we'd already started work on the next one.  Elaine Fernandez:  The pace of change in the 21st century requires companies to be agile and adapt quickly to  emerging global challenges and shifting stakeholder expectations.  Balancing foresight and the ability to evolve as the business landscape changes is therefore not  just a strategic advantage, but a prerequisite for businesses to build internal resilience and  thrive.

The Political Economy: Inequity Within the Multilateral System 

### keyTakeaway
Professor Jayati Ghosh underscored the inadequacies in the current multilateral negotiation system, particularly in the economic and trade architecture, given it is dominated by powerful players like the United States, Europe, and Japan. Multilateral negotiations, especially in economic and financial matters, lack true inclusivity. The major economies of the G7 and G20 operate in a way that prioritises the interests of a few powerful nations. Changes in monetary policies by advanced economies, particularly a sharp increase in interest rates, can have significant repercussions on the rest of the world. Developing nations face capital flight, fiscal challenges, and a multidimensional crisis caused by policies beyond their control. Given the challenges faced by lower and middle-income countries, Professor Jayati Ghosh anticipates a shift towards regional, bilateral, and domestic alternatives that enable autonomy and equity simultaneously.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Political Economy: Inequity Within the  Multilateral System  Rohan Hazell:  Multilateral systems, ostensibly designed for equal participation, are often skewed in favour of  major economies like the United States, Europe, Japan, and emerging powers like China.  Jayati Ghosh, Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusett s Amherst, explores the  complexities of global economic governance and its impact on different nations, including the  trend of lower and middle - income countries seeking alternative economic strategies in response  to stark economic inequalities.  Prof. Jayathi Ghosh:  Clearly   multilateral   negotiations   or   international   negotiations   should   be   conducted  multilaterally, that is with all the parties involved, all the stakeholders. That really isn't how it's  operating at the moment, especially in terms of the economic archite cture, the trade and  financial architecture.  Ultimately it is the rules and laws of the big players, the large economies, particularly the United  States and Europe, and Japan, and to a lesser extent, China, which is still an emerging kid on the  bloc of great powers. This is where really things are de cided, and that's why G7 has played such  an outsized role, because G7 represents most of these big major Western powers, and then that's  been expanded to G20. But let's recognize that G20 increasingly is less effective as an  independent organisation. It's   really something that rubber stamps what G7 decides.  Now, if G7 is so important, then it should be representing the interests of the entire world. If it is  the leaders of the world, then it should represent the world and at least act in the interest of the  world. What we've seen, especially in the last four   years, is that it doesn't do that. It acts in its  own interests.  The G7 takes economic decisions that affect everyone in the world without concern for what is  happening to those countries. So, when there was a pandemic, they decided they needed a big  fiscal stimulus, and they did it. 25 - 30% of GDP. Additional money was   spent. The IMF estimated  that between January 2020 and March 2021, around $11 trillion dollars additionally was spent.
  But 80% of that came from just 10 rich countries, 80%. And the rest, developing countries really  could not spend even as much as they had spent after the global financial crisis. More than half  of that 55% came from the US alone. The US spent around $30,00 0 per capita over this period,  additional money.  The low - income country spent $1   -   $2 per capita additionally, because either they are facing debt  distress and they have to make huge debt repayments, or they cannot actually extend themselves  to spend more even in a period of huge crisis, or they're worri ed about capital flight because they  have open capital accounts and capital can move in and out. There is a fear that if they run large  fiscal deficits, they will see an outflow. And this was a genuine fear for many countries, which  actually prevented them   from spending much more. And if you don't spend more, obviously your  recovery is much less. You don't recover to this same extent. Your wage income doesn't recover.  Employment doesn't recover. Your health conditions don't improve.  All of these things have happened across the developing world to varying degrees, but then these  rich countries have done the monetary expansion over the last 10 - 14 years as much as they  wanted after the global financial crisis, massive monetary expansions   and low interest rates, then  doing a large fiscal expansion. Then when the Ukraine war occurred and there were threats of  inflation, they decided to tighten monetary policy. So, they reduce their liquidity expansion and  most of all, they increase interest   rates. We've had the sharpest increase in interest rates in the  advanced economies that we have seen in a century. A coordinated dramatic increase in interest  rates.  They were exceptionally low, and I don't dispute that, but the dramatic increase has immediate  effects on the rest of the world, because capital flows back to the rich country. So, money that  was coming in even to otherwise healthy, you know, properly func tioning economies, flows out.  So, when they face capital flight, which is not because of anything that they have done, but  because of policies in the advanced economies, they then have to have further   risen   in their own  interest rates. They have to do further retrenchment of their fiscal policies. They have a  “polycrisis” as Adam Tooze has called it. They have a multi - dimensional crisis, which is not of their  own making.  So basically, the fact that the advanced economies can take policies that suit themselves without  concern for how they're impacting others and that they increasingly do so, that they go ahead  and do whatever they want without thinking, at least I should ma ke some allowances, at least I  should increase the SDR allocations of the IMF so that other countries have some liquidity. At  least I should worry about putting in place some kinds of capital management techniques so that  capital is not so volatile. They d on't say any of that.  So, the lack of international solidarity is so evident, but it's not just a question of economic justice  or equality. It's not just that. It's in their own economic self - interest. Unfortunately, they don't  realise that. They don't realise that it's in thei r own enlightened self - interest to make sure that
  this infection does not take on in the rest of the world because it'll come back to affect their own  economy.  I think now lower and middle - income countries really have no option but to think of alternative  strategies because they are being so buffeted by these winds, not from their own making, and  they're facing ecological crises. We are already in the midst of cl imate change that is forcing us  to adapt in ways that we can't afford.  It's creating loss and damage that we, you know, we don't have the money to deal with. So, we  have to think of alternative strategies. And I think some of this is already happening partly  because of the Ukraine war and the sanctions that were imposed, whic h have made many  countries look for alternative arrangements to get oil.  They're going in for bilateral trade deals, they're going in for other financing arrangements, and  we are seeing a different trade nexus emerging. We are seeing attempts for example, in Africa,  the African CDC with the assistance of the World Health Organi zation is trying to set up an  alternative technology hub for mRNA vaccines to create their own because the big players, the  big pharma companies will not share their knowledge. So, you have to go out there and do your  own.  We are seeing the emergence of regional finance arrangements, you know, currency swaps, like  the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR)   arrangement in Latin America. So, I think we are going  to see more and more regional and bilateral and domestic alternatives   because increasingly  countries have no choice.  I think that's also not a bad thing because it works two ways. One, it does give you some hope of  an autonomous development trajectory which really have not had. We've been completely  determined by the global winds for the last 20 - 30 years, but also it for ces the rich countries to  actually sit up and take notice. And currently the low -   and middle - income countries don't really  have much bargaining power in all of these global multilateral arrangements.  We're going to forge our own path, which actually does give you some targeting power. So maybe  that will concentrate the minds of G7 leaders and force them to be a little bit more  accommodating and recognising our joint humanity and the joint challenges th at we face.  Rohan Hazell:  Lower -   and middle - income countries are beginning to explore innovative approaches to  economic development and resist pressure from high - income nations to conform to policies and  agreements that may be well - meaning but do not serve their people.
  However, more needs to be done to achieve greater equity among nations. This starts with  understanding how geopolitics impacts economic policy and decision - making in our world today.

Beyond Western-Controlled Developmental Investment

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani highlighted how the shift to multipolarity is rewriting the power dynamics of developmental investment.As a result of inequitable practices from Western-led development institutions like the World Bank, African states are increasingly seeking alternatives and perceive investments from Asian nations like China as avenues that offer freedom of choice and autonomy.European opposition to Chinese investment in Africa is counterproductive to the former’s long-term interests, as it reduces migration pressures stemming from demographic imbalances between the continents.Instead of dictating outcomes for others from a position of superiority, the West should be more democratic in allowing emerging powers to choose their own futures.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Beyond Western-Controlled Development Investment  Rohan Hazell:  For much of the developing world, foreign direct investment, or FDI, from capital rich Western  nations was the bedrock of development. But it often came at the cost. Resource exploitation,  limited technology transfer and skewed trade agreements.  But what happens to the nature of FDI, in a world where emerging powers are increasingly able  to negotiate on a level playing field?  Walking us through this is Professor Kishore Mahbubani, former President of the United Nations  Security Council and Distinguished Fellow at the Asian Research Institute.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  One lesson I learned as ambassador to the UN for 10 years is that my best friends in the United  Nations   were   the   ambassadors   of   Africa,   because   I   found   the   Africans   to   be   very  straightforward, very direct, very open and very honest. And so I found it such a tragedy that in  private, many of the Europeans still treated the Africans with a great deal of condescension.  Even after Africa was decolonised, the African states were effectively bullied by the West. And  this has been documented by many great scholars. And I will give you an example.  Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winner in economics, wrote in one of his books, how when a  very poor country called Ethiopia paid off early a high interest loan to American banks, because  they used that loan to buy aeroplanes, they made money,   they paid back the loan early. And  because they paid back the loan early and the American banks lost money, the American banks  called the United States Treasury. The United States Treasury called the World Bank, and World  Bank loans were pulled from Ethiopia.  So Ethiopia was punished for paying off a loan early to American banks. And this is an example  of how the African states were bullied by the West. And that, I think, is very unwise.  
And so that's the fundamental reason why many African states welcome the investment from  China. And by the way, not just from China, but from other Asian countries - from China, India,  Japan - because they believe that when the Asians come and invest in Africa also, then the  Africans have a choice, they have alternatives. And so if the World Bank today pulls a loan from  Ethiopia, what's going to happen is that Ethiopia can go either to the Asian Infrastructure  Investment Bank or they can go to the New Development Bank that was set up by the BRICS  countries. So there are other alternatives that are provided to the Africans.  So I think the return of Asia and the resurgence of Asia is a positive development for the African  countries. And by the way, when the Asians invest in Africa and do more economic deals with  Africa, they are actually doing Europe a big favour because the African states do not develop.  And if we do not create jobs in Africa, then what's going to happen is that Africa will export  Africans to Europe. Because you look at the demographic imbalance that is happening.  In the year 1950, Europe's population was twice that of Africa's. Today, Africa's population is  more than double that of Europe. More than double. By 2100, Africa's population will be ten  times the size of Europe. Ten times. So it is in Europe's interest to try and create as many jobs as  possible in Africa. So Europe should be welcoming Chinese investment in Africa.  Unfortunately, because some European states have become politically so supplicant to the  United States and because the United States is engaged in a geopolitical contest with China,  because the United States is opposing Chinese investment in Africa, the European states are  also opposing Chinese investment in Africa. And I think by opposing Chinese investment in  Africa, they are shooting themselves in the foot. They are actually undermining their own  interests. They should actually be sending China a thank-you note for investing in Africa. And  the Europeans don't understand where their own long term interests lie when they campaign  against or resist Chinese investment in Africa.  Well, I would say from the point of view of the African countries, they would be happy if they  had been given the choice. So I think it's good for the West to offer its aid, investment to Africa,  and so good for China to offer aid and investment to Africa. But recently, I heard a podcast with  an American guy called Kaiser Kuo. And on his podcast, one of his guests said he just spoke to a  Kenyan minister who says every time the West comes and provides aid, it lectures the Africans.  And so this Kenyan minister said, does the United States lecture Saudi Arabia on LGBT rights in  the same way that he lectures the Kenyans? And I think it's very unwise for the United States  
and for the West to lecture the Africans. I think we must treat the Africans with more respect,  and we must let them decide what kind of society they want to have.  And I believe that just as we in Southeast Asia have worked out our own ways of developing our  own societies, the United States should be more democratic and allow the African states and  the Asian states and the Latin American states to choose their own futures. Because the days  when the United States or Europe could decide for the rest of the world are over. And that's a  fundamental psychological step that the United States and Europe need to take.  And that's why this course on the post-Western world is so timely. Because we need to educate  the West on how to deal with the world. The remaining 88%, because the remaining 88% today  know what is good for them, and they can make their own decisions, and it's better to have  cooperation within the West and the rest on the basis of equality and respect.  Rohan Hazell:  The impact of foreign investment is complex and more countries are recognising that any deal  with   the   West   and   emerging   powers   like   China   must   be   carefully   scrutinised   to avoid  exploitation of workers and environmental damage.  In light of this, countries are now exercising greater autonomy in deciding   which foreign  investments and partnerships are worth prioritising.

Externalities of Production

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the positive and negative externalities that can occur during the production phase of goods and services.Positive externalities of production benefit society without compensation to the producer beyond the market price of the goods and services they provide. An example is the 3-point seat belt - car manufacturers are not paid for the public health savings a seatbelt results in.Positive externalities often result from a combination of private-sector investment and public-sector support or regulation. Examples include vaccines, renewable energy, and even microchips.Negative externalities of production impose costs on society that are not reflected in the prices of goods and services, leading to market failures where the full social costs of economic activity are not borne by producers. An example is when companies dump pollution rather than paying for correct disposal.Addressing negative externalities requires government intervention through legislation, regulation, and pricing mechanisms to align private incentives with mitigating the harmful impacts of production.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Externalities of Production  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are the costs or benefits of third parties from economic activity that are not  factored into the price we pay for goods or services.  And   they exist even in the production of goods and services. These are known as the  externalities of production, and are what we’ll explore in this chapter.  Rohan Hazell:  Positive externalities of production occur when society benefits from the manufacture of goods  or services, but the producer responsible for its production does not receive any additional  payment for the benefits incurred, apart from the market price.  An everyday example would be a flower shop with an outdoor display that opens on a small  high street. Local residents and shoppers benefit from the sights and smells of fresh plants and  flowers, and neighbouring businesses benefit from the spill-over effects of potential customers  drawn to the area by the colourful display and fragrance, but the flower shop itself does not  receive direct compensation for beautifying the area, and nor would it include this in the price  of its goods and services.  Another example would be when product creation results in technological innovation that is  shared with others and has a wider benefit for society. For example, if a company engineers a  technology that helps it produce a product in a cleaner, less environmentally destructive way,  and that same technology is adopted by others or even mandated by the government, we could  consider this a positive externality of that product and its creation.  Perhaps one of the most impactful positive externalities of production in modern times  occurred in 1959 when Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin developed the 3-point seat belt and, rather  than maximise profit from this ground-breaking invention, the company decided the patent was  to be left open for other car manufacturers to adopt in the greater interest of public safety.  
Therefore, the number of people being admitted to government hospitals because of injuries  resulting from car accidents was lowered, reducing government spending on public health.  Examples like this are common. In fact, many technological advancements adopted by the  private sector that are a net benefit to society have resulted from government investment in  research and development. Vaccines, microchips, renewable energy, GPS and MRI technologies  are just a few examples.  These positive externalities associated with State-sponsored R&D are at odds with the notion  that government is an obstacle to doing business and promoting economic development.  It also shows that many times, products and services that produce positive externalities are a  result of private sector investment and public sector support or even regulation.  Unfortunately, negative externalities of production can occur throughout the entire value chain,  from resource extraction to product manufacturing, through to marketing and distribution.  These externalities are much easier to come by, because of the early belief that resources are  plentiful, that markets self-correct, and people should be given the chance to consume as they  wish, for example with the sale of cigarettes.  They have created and sustained many of the existential threats and societal traumas we face  today. They are the harmful effects on society and nature that result from a business producing  goods and services which do not account for all the externalities in the cost of production or in  the price paid by consumers and the effects of consumption.  The classic example, and one that was used by Arthur Pigou in his development of the concept  of externalities, is the pollution caused by industrial activity.  If, in the process of manufacturing its products, a company pollutes the air, water or land, it  imposes costs on the environment that are not reflected in its cost of production nor the price  of its goods, this would constitute a negative externality. For example, if a river is polluted by a  chemical company, the government will eventually be required to clean it up, yet the price of  manufacturing this product by the chemical company does not reflect this clean-up cost .  
And because many natural resources are used by all members of society, humans also bear the  cost of these types of externality by breathing dirty air, drinking tainted water and eating food  cultivated on contaminated soil.  Unless the government steps in using legislation and regulations and puts a price on all the  pollution resulting from production, and a value on the ecosystem services provided by our  natural resources, the polluting company will continue to produce and sell its products without  factoring in the true costs. It essentially has a free ride on the damaging externalities it is  directly responsible for.  In these instances, producers make their decisions based only on the direct cost and profit  opportunity of production, not the indirect costs to those harmed by the pollution. Since these  costs are not paid by the producer, they are not passed onto the consumer who pays less than  they should for the product.  This means the social, or total costs of production are larger than the private costs – this is why  externalities are referred to as a market failure. Thus, the margin of profit is a function of the  scale of the externalities produced and not priced into the producer’s economic activity.  In the pollution example, ill health in humans and animals, adverse impacts on food production,  and potential damage to local landscapes, tourism and property development can all be  considered as negative externalities or social costs of production.  Elaine Fernandez:  In summary, externalities can occur during the production phase, imposing unaccounted-for  costs on society and the environment, such as pollution from industrial activity.  The failure to incorporate these external costs into product prices leads to market failures,  where the social costs exceed the private costs incurred by producers. This necessitates  government intervention to correct the imbalance and ensure that both   producers and  consumers bear the true costs of production.  But it’s not all bad news. Positive externalities of production occur when society benefits from  goods or services without compensating the producer. These positive impacts often arise from a  
combination of private sector innovation and public sector support, challenging the notion that  government intervention hinders economic development.

How Pollution Leads to Ungovernable Societies

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the potential impacts unchecked pollution will have on both the future of humanity and the environment. The impacts of pollution don’t stop at just climate change. Without drastic action to keep pollution within planetary boundaries, the world will become increasingly uninhabitable, driving further social unrest and ultimately rendering our societies ungovernable. It’s imperative that States recognise this trajectory, and proactively create strategies that mitigate environmental degradation while also addressing its sociopolitical ramifications, while business, civil society, and individuals must engage in sustainable practices and advocate for policies that align with environmental conservation.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  How Pollution Leads to Ungovernable Societies  Elaine Fernandez:  In 1972, Professor Emeritus of Climate Strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School, Jorgen  Randers, co - authored the seminal report "Limits to Growth" which predicted that the world  would not be able to support civilisation growth beyond the year 2100.  This was one of the first international efforts to question whether "growth at all costs" was a  sustainable approach to global economic development. It determined that there were 5 limits  to   growth on   Earth: population, agricultural production, natural res ources, industrial  production and pollution.  While   the   unprecedented   industrial   growth,   urbanisation   and   ever - increasing   global  population we've witnessed since then have yet to result in resource or societal collapse,  they've fuelled a major existential threat: pollution.  Fifty years on from the publication of "The Limits to Growth", you'll hear from Professor  Randers about the impacts that unchecked pollution will have on the environment,  geopolitics and sustainable development of our civilisation as a whole.  Professor Jorgen Randers:  So, what has happened over the last 50 years is that humanity has continued to grow  physically, both in population size and in the resources used, and in the emissions of  pollutants and CO2. The most important learning from the last 50 years is that it has   shown  that the real problem is climate emissions.  So we are facing a pollution problem. So what will happen is fairly obvious as we continue  emitting too much CO2, the temperature is going to increase, and gradually over the next  couple of generations, and we will experience damage as a consequence of thi s.  First of all, extreme weather. Then the bleaching of the coral reefs. Then the shift in  agricultural productivity in changes as a consequence of extreme weather, droughts, forest  fires, et cetera. And gradually over time, this will lead to a decline in ave rage wellbeing. The  incomes are likely to continue to go up, but the negative side effects of deteriorating nature  is going to influence the wellbeing of people. And when the wellbeing starts to decline, then  you get social unrest basically, which makes it   difficult for governments to do anything about  the underlying problems.
  And my feeling is that the next 60 years, unless we do something dramatic, will be a gradually  deteriorating climate, and then we will see social collapses in vulnerable nations. So  essentially national breakdowns of the type of Somalia, Afghanistan, those   types of countries  that move into being unrulable, so that even if the government wanted to do something  about the underlying problem, they no longer can.  But I do not believe in a major global environmental collapse where suddenly one day you  open the door and it is plus six degrees centigrade outside and everything disappears. I don't  think that's what's going to happen. It's just going to get worse and wo rse and worse and  worse, very gradually. And then suddenly we will get social crisis, not environmental crisis.  Elaine Fernandez:  As Professor Randers puts it, the changes resulting from CO2 pollution are gradual and often  difficult to spot within a single lifetime. But rising temperatures and extreme weather will  nonetheless culminate in serious challenges for humans, the likes of w hich we have not  encountered in recorded history.  Just in 2023 alone, we've seen unparalleled widespread extreme weather events, like  wildfires in Canada and the Hawaiian island of Maui, or Cyclone Mocha striking Myanmar and  Bangladesh, resulting in widescale damage to property, loss of livelihoods, and a dverse  impacts on health and wellbeing. And as societal wellbeing continues to deteriorate, social  unrest will rise, making it harder for governments to enact the necessary policies for  sustainable development.

Access to Freshwater is a Global Crisis

### keyTakeaway
Freshwater scarcity is a critical issue. Despite water covering 70% of Earth's surface, only a small fraction is accessible for human use, which has significant implications for global health, agriculture, and industry.Freshwater scarcity is exacerbated by overuse, inefficient agricultural practices, underinvestment in water infrastructure, pollution, and climate change. Tackling the freshwater crisis requires efficiently managing resources, incorporating fair pricing to reflect the true value of water, reducing wasteful consumption, and enhancing infrastructure for better distribution and treatment.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  A ccess to Freshwater is a Global Crisis  Olivia Lai:  Water makes up 70% of the Earth's surface area, but the total volume of freshwater on Earth  is just 3%. And just 0.03% is easily accessible for the survival of human beings. This primarily  includes domestic, agricultural, and industrial use. It is importan t to understand that we  cannot easily make more freshwater. Because of its scarcity in its pervasive use in everything  from meeting needs of domestic life to agriculture, energy generation, and industry,  freshwater has been called the most precious resourc e on Earth. Yet the demand for  freshwater is constantly rising and we are not yet able to meet current needs.  According to the World Resources Institute, over the last 50 years, water demand has  increased by 250%. Despite this, around 1.6 billion people worldwide lack access to drinking  water, also known as potable water. This impacts their ability to live healthy   lives, avoid  certain communicable diseases, and practice good hygiene.  A study led by NASA revealed that societies across the world are consuming freshwater at a  faster rate than it can be replenished. 21 out of the world's 37 major aquifers, which are  underground stores of fresh   water are receding. In India, the Ganges basin is depleting by an  estimated 6.3   centimetres   every year. While in California, 1,200 wells ran dry in a five - year  window between 2011 and 2016. Needless to say, if we continue to stress our freshwater  reserves, the consequences to our societies and environ ment will be dire.  There are five main driving factors behind freshwater stress, which we must bear in mind  when considering adaptation and mitigation strategies. First is clearly overuse. The global  average of water consumption per person is 3,800   litres   a day. 10% of this is the water we  directly use for drinking and hygiene, while the remaining 90% we indirectly use in the  production of the goods we   buy,   food in particular. But we must understand that in many  low - income   countries, this is much lower.  Rising population is obviously a major contributing factor behind water overuse, especially as  a lot of water is not used sustainably. For example, agriculture uses 70% of the world's  freshwater, but many commonplace irrigation systems lose up to 50% of ap plied water to  evaporation rather than absorption by plants, meaning that farmers could use half as much  water when growing crops.  It is also important to remember that over - consumption of freshwater is related to lifestyle.  The average US citizen, for example, consumes 6,800   litres   a day compared to just 1 , 600   litres  for a Yemeni citizen. This is because of liberal domestic use for showers, cleaning, watering
  lawns, as well as generally very high consumption of goods that require water for production.  Needless to say, over consumptive   behaviours   are being exacerbated by industrialisation and  urbanisation, which increases the freshwater demand for agriculture, manufacturing, and  household use.  Second,   under - pricing   and underinvestment. In many countries, public water companies  charge households a fraction of the cost for delivering water, let alone maintaining or  expanding water infrastructure. Calculations by the International Monetary Fund suggest that  this   under - pricing   resulted in governments paying about $456 billion worldwide for the water  consumed by people and businesses.  Because governments often pay for water like this, it is often more profitable for companies  to set up new freshwater extraction operations than it is to improve efficiencies in the existing  infrastructure,   meaning   that   water   systems   around   the   world   are   often   chronically  underinvested in.  Third, pollution. Human activities can introduce contaminants into water sources that are  extremely difficult or even impossible to clean. Agricultural runoff in the form of pesticides  and fertilisers is a major contributing factor here, as is human waste,   which is improperly  managed in most countries around the world, and thus finds its way into rivers and lakes.  Industrial activities also lead to pollution of freshwater, sometimes, with potent heavy metals  and chemicals, which are extremely damaging to people and flora and fauna alike. The Global  Water Partnership has estimated that 300 to 400 million tonnes of in dustrial waste are  discharged into water bodies every year, while 90% of domestic sewage is left untreated in  low - income countries contaminating water sources like rivers.  Fourth is the watershed degradation. A watershed is a land area that channels water into  rivers and is at risk of being impacted by land use change such as conversion for urbanisation,  logging, agriculture, and tourism. When forests are felled, wetlands dr ained, soil tilled, or  concrete laid down, the n   “ natural infrastructure ”   is less able to stabilise soil, regulate water  flow, and purify water. One study found that watersheds lost 6% on average of their forest  cover in the first 15 years of this century ,   f urther endangering water security for the global  populace.  Fifth and last is climate change. Rising temperatures are causing changes in rainfall patterns  leading to more frequent   droughts, but also more frequent floods. In 2021, there were 223  recorded flooding events, the second - highest in recorded history. While in 2017, Cape Town  in South Africa experienced droughts so severe that it nearly ran out of water, which caused  mass panic.  This compounds the challenge of water scarcity, particularly in regions that are already water  stressed.
  In summary, overuse,   under - pricing , and underinvestment as well as pollution, destruction of  watersheds, and climate change are the five main factors that are leading to what some are  calling a freshwater crisis. Freshwater is finite and exceedingly precious as one of the only  resources in volved in all households and major industries. Having a clear understanding of  the drivers of water stress will help governments and businesses ensure we can consume  water sustainably for the foreseeable future.

Unpacking the Role of Business in Society

### keyTakeaway
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, the focus is shifting from traditional shareholder primacy to a broader stakeholder perspective, acknowledging the dynamic interplay between business, government, society, and the environment.Business operations are governed by licences from authorities, implying adherence to regulations and a broader social responsibility beyond compliance.The expanding pool of stakeholders businesses are now accountable for includes employees, suppliers, communities, and even ecosystems, challenging the traditional shareholder-focused model.Modern business debates are redefining corporate ownership, accountability, and purpose, with a growing trend of prioritising stakeholder interests over traditional shareholder returns.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Unpacking the Role of Business in Society  Elaine Fernandez:  When you think about the role of business in society, what comes to mind? Is it maximising  profit in returns for shareholders? Creating employment opportunities and paying taxes? Or is it  to provide products and services in response to societal needs and demand?  In this core module, we unpack the role of business in society with Eric Stryson, Managing  Director of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, and look at the tensions between social utility,  value creation and financial objectives. In this chapter, Eric explores this licence to operate and  the responsibilities businesses have to a broad range of stakeholders.  Eric Stryson:  It's important to remember that business stakeholders expectations are shifting and constantly  shift in response to changing socioeconomic and political conditions. So, what we expect of  businesses in society changes given the external changes that we experience and the changing  technology landscape, the changing economic landscape and so on. Consumer demand is  actually a kind of shifting blend of both needs and desires. There are certain things that we  need to live a comfortable life; housing, clothing, food, water, mobility, et cetera. And many of  those, most of those are provided by the business sector.  But there are other things that we just desire that enhance our life, make our experience  pleasurable, and all of those needs and desires then contribute to the demand which business  responds to. Business then has to obtain a licence to operate which is granted by the  government on behalf of society.  So, remember the pillars of a well-functioning society. It is the government which actually  grants that licence to operate to a business, to the private sector. And that licence comes with  certain obligations, certain rules and regulations that a business must follow, and indeed,  business can seek to go beyond those minimum regulations, understanding that there is also a  social obligation for business.  
We should not forget, however, that business is therefore beholden to that licence to operate  which is granted by the government. It is not business that sets the rules, it is the government  which lays out the rules of the game.  So, then the question comes: Who is it that business should really serve? The shareholders or a  broader range of stakeholders? You might have heard this term "stakeholders", which has  become much more common in the media and in the popular business narrative today. We  have always prioritised shareholders, those who own a financial stake in the company through a  share or through shareholdings. But there are many other stakeholders who play an essential  role in the business activity. There are the employees who actually do the work. There are  vendors, suppliers and external partners who provide all of the essential goods and services  that business uses to do its business. Of course, there are the local community and the  neighbouring people around a business, particularly in a business that manufactures things or  has a physical facility, then the community around that facility is a direct stakeholder in that  business. There are also community groups who respond to the business. There are oversight  organisations like consumer protection organisations and then of course government regulatory  bodies and even competitors we can consider as stakeholders of the business.  More and more, we are also considering local ecosystems and even regional and global  ecosystems as a stakeholder in the business. The ecosystem has a stake in the business activity  because the business activity impacts upon the health and the sustainability of that ecosystem.  So, we should understand this broad range of stakeholders in the business for which the  financial shareholders are one subset. And therefore the question is: Who should business  serve? The shareholders or the stakeholders?  The traditional view, at least for the last half century, has been that business serves the  shareholders first and foremost. And this is premised on what's called the Agency Theory, which  views business purely through a financial lens and is the foundation of our modern corporate  governance systems. It's essentially premised on notions of private property and it focuses on  the tension between the owners and the managers, or the principals of the business and the  agents   who work on behalf of that principal. And this agency theory has provided the  intellectual or the ideological foundations that puts shareholders at the forefront and which has  discounted the value of other stakeholders in the business.  The prevailing orthodoxy for the last 50 years was well summed up by Milton Friedman in 1970,  who said, "There is one and only one social responsibility of business and that is to use its  resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the  
rules of the game, which is to say it engages in open and free competition without deception or  fraud."  That is the classic statement from Milton Friedman from 1970, which has provided the  intellectual underpinnings of the vast majority of our capitalist business activity to date. Today,  however,   more   and   more   business   leaders   are   starting   to consider Stakeholder Theory.  Stakeholder theory recognises a much wider range of inputs into management decision making,  strategy and even notions of ethics in business leadership. This stakeholder theory has been  gaining acceptance based on the expanded access to information which we all now have, and of  course,   the   increasing   tensions   within   society which has been unleashed by the COVID  pandemic, the lockdowns, the social and political turmoil that we've seen in many of our  societies.  So, now there is a real debate as to whether we should prioritise shareholders or stakeholders.  And stakeholder theory has been rising in prominence in the last few years. Why is this  important? Well, business decision-making and accountability is driven by our understanding of  ownership and who we believe fundamentally owns the corporation.  Elaine Fernandez:  The private sector is often viewed as the engine of growth and prosperity in  many economies. However, as Eric has highlighted, businesses still need to conduct their  operations within parameters set by society. This is known as the licence to operate and in  recent years this has been developed further. The licence to operate is granted by society  and society is comprised of different stakeholders, from government bodies to communities  and even the environment. This is the crux of stakeholder theory, which states that businesses  do not only have a responsibility to shareholders of business owners, but to broader society as  well.

Access to Basic Needs and Epidemics & Pandemics

### keyTakeaway
The focus of this chapter is on societal shortfalls. There are four, including lack of access to basic needs, epidemics &amp; pandemics, conflict, and wide-scale societal traumas. This chapter examines the first two. Impoverished communities, often lacking safe and secure food, clean water, healthcare, education, and more, face daily challenges. The absence of these basic needs hinders communities' quality of life, productivity, public health, and socioeconomic development. Ensuring access to basic needs is crucial for building resilience against other existential threats like epidemics and pandemics. Meeting these needs is a key objective of redesigning society. The impact of epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19, can be long-term and disruptive, affecting healthcare systems, economies, and societal stability. Factors like drug resistance and poor healthcare amplify the risk, especially in lower-income nations. In an interconnected world, infectious diseases can spread rapidly through international travel and trade networks, posing risks to entire supply chains and regions. Resilience and preparedness are essential to manage the healthcare and socioeconomic implications of infectious diseases.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Access to Basic Needs and Epidemics & Pandemics  Rohan Hazell:  Every day there seems to be a new social challenge that we need to overcome. It can be hard to  keep track or to know which we should prioritise. That's why we're focusing on the four societal  shortfalls that have the biggest impact on our planet and in turn our societies. These are lack of  access to basic needs, epidemics and pandemics, conflict, and wide-scale societal traumas.  The first step towards solving these challenges begins with understanding their causes and  impacts, and then thinking critically about how you and your organisation can contribute to  improving them. In this chapter, we'll start with the most fundamental societal shortfall: lack of  access to basic needs.  Access to Basic Needs  Imagine waking up tomorrow without access to electricity. or clean drinking water. Imagine if  there were no schools to learn in or hospitals to visit in the event of injury or illness. Maybe you  don't need to imagine this reality, perhaps you grew up without access to these or other basic  services. Whatever your background, consider for a moment the impact it would have on your  life if you didn't have access to the services most of us consider necessities, and take for granted  every day.  For impoverished communities around the world, this is a daily reality. Up to 750 million people  don't have access to basic needs or benefit from social safety nets. This means their day-to-day  lives are missing one of the following eight components: safe and secure food, clean water,  affordable housing, health care, consistent energy supply, sanitation, dignified work, and  education. Many of us in higher income countries take all of these for granted.  But for families that lack any number of basic needs, this presents an existential threat. And  drastically limits the community's ability to improve their quality of life. Given that much of  their time and resources are spent on meeting the baseline day-to-day and month-to-month. At  the national level, this impacts productivity, public health, socio-economic development and the  overall wellbeing of a nation.  
A major component of redesigning society is to better understand and manage the drivers of  change with the aim of ensuring everyone has access to basic needs so they can move from  surviving to thriving. This will help them build resilience to other existential threats they are  currently vulnerable to, like epidemics and pandemics, which we'll look at next.  Epidemics and Pandemics  The second societal shortfall is epidemics and pandemics. COVID-19 highlighted to us all just  how damaging and disruptive widespread disease can be, leading to a breakdown of healthcare  systems, economic turmoil and societal instability. These impacts can be long-term, taking years  for communities and countries to fully recover from, especially if treatments and cures are not  forthcoming.  For this reason, epidemics and pandemics are an existential threat on national and global scales.  Other human factors increase this risk too, such as the lab-based development of aggressive  diseases, or the overuse of antimicrobial drugs like antibiotics, leading to strains of pathogens  that are resistant to treatments.  Of course, in lower income nations, high population density, poor sanitation, and lack of  healthcare all amplify the spread of infectious disease. And in today's highly interconnected  world, these impacts are even more pronounced. Infectious diseases can spread rapidly through  international travel and trade which puts entire supply chains and regions at risk.  For   these   reasons,   Epidemics   and   pandemics   are   considered   societal shortfalls and not  environmental crises. Far more lethal pandemics than COVID-19 have occurred in the past, like  the Spanish flu of 1918, which left nearly 50 million dead. But in less interconnected times, the  social and economic impacts of such pandemics were far smaller.  Going forward, countries across the world will have to become more resilient to be prepared for  the healthcare implications of infectious disease, as well as their impact on the functioning of  economic, governance and societal systems.  In this chapter, we've looked at the first two societal shortfalls. These two existential threats in  particular are front of mind for many of   us, given rising income inequality, the increasing  visibility of global poverty, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. What's important is to recognise  that these threats don't exist in isolation. They are intimately related to the drivers of change, as  well as how each country's economic policies, social norms, and governance systems operate.  
In the coming chapter, we'll explore the next two societal shortfalls: conflict and societal  traumas.

Making Business Decisions: The Tradeoffs

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that business decision-making requires careful consideration of trade-offs and the impact these will have on the company, society, and the environment at large. Creating both profit and social value requires businesses to think long term and integrate sustainability throughout the organisation.Companies can start by accounting for the risks of inaction, exploring the business opportunities presented by focusing on societal needs, and addressing the externalities in their business model. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Making Business Decisions: The Trade - Offs  Elaine Fernandez:  Any attempt towards transformation necessarily comes with trade - offs, where taking action to  progress one aspect of a business, even in a more sustainable direction, may have unintended  adverse impacts on another or even on society and the planet. To help   us make sense of this,  Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer of DBS Group, talks us through his thought process and  approach to making tough decisions in the face of trade - offs.  Piyush Gupta:  Let me first start by stating the obvious. This is not a   science;   this is an art form. It's very  judgmental. But let me narrate a story to you about how we thought about the fossil fuel  industry, so it'll help the students get an understanding of how nuanced and fine this thinking  needs to be. So number one, quite clear   to us, we thought about transitioning to a low carbon  fuel world, that the crux of this is the energy problem. If you think about, if any of the students  have read this book by Vaclav Smil on how the world really works, he very succinctly makes the  case t hat if you think about the world of 200 years ago, in the world of today, the only meaningful,  real driver of change has been as an individual, as a person. We are consuming 700 times more  energy than we did that time. And because the extractive power is i mproved by 5 x, actually from  a consumption prism, we're using 3,500 times more energy than we did 200 years ago. So it's  really about energy.  Now, we have sourced this energy through fossil fuels and that's been the heart of the problems.  Everything else is a downstream impact of that. It really comes from that. Where do you get the  energy from? What is the size of the problem now? When therefor e, as you look forward, it's  quite clear to me that to solve this big issue, the climate issue in particular, we really have to  rethink the energy ecosystem. And it's quite clear to everybody else.   Therefore,   they tested  renewables and solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear pump power et cetera. At the same time, this  is where you got to be realistic and pragmatic that every form of fossil fuel does not generate the  same amount of carbon. And equally second thing, t hat you cannot turn off all   energy in the  world overnight and say we're going to go to a new form of energy for two reasons. One, there's  trillions of dollars which have gone into creating the existing energy infrastructure. It's just
  physically and humanly impossible to say turn off the switch, we're going to replace it all with a  new energy infrastructure. It takes a lot of time to get there. And second is even if you got a way  to squeeze the time. In many cases, the cost points and t echnologies are not there yet. There's a  lot of difference. Some countries, solar, for example, is lower than carbon and fossil fuel costs.  But in many other countries, it's still not there. So you've got to keep that pragmatic thing in  mind. Can we do it?   How quickly can you do it? And second, how much extra would it cost in  some circumstances to be able to achieve that?   So that's the background.  So we started thinking about fossil fuel. We started first with coal. Coal is the dirtiest fuel. It  creates the greatest amount of carbon. Even within coal, by the way, there are grades. There's  dirty coal and there's clean coal and there's ultracritical c oal. So you can figure out different  shades of coal. And in the beginning, we actually went down that path. We said, okay, we'll get  out of the dirty coal, but some of the clean coal is not that carbon emitting. So maybe we should  work with people to do th at. One of the reasons why I didn't want to turn off, I mean, the simple  answer would be to get out of all energy, oil, gas, coal. I was guided by my own youth, and when  you say, how do decisions get taken?  I grew up in India, and in my memory, all the way through my teen years and my schooling years,  India was power deficit. We did not have electricity from the grid. You had constant blackouts.  You had to try and use diesel generators to study at night. And   I made the case that even today,  in some of the rural parts of the country, people don't get electricity. If you're a kid, forget India,  in Samarang and Indonesia, and you don't have access to electricity. I think it's a fundamental  right. So you sit back   and say, okay, I could turn off the entire financing of the energy  infrastructure. That poor kid in Semarang or somebody in a village in India is going to be deprived  of electricity. The ability to study, learn, get out, social mobility, economic growth. I s that a good  choice?  So question number one, how do you make the big benefits and trade - offs? The second question  is, let's assume that it's a choice that needs to be made. Then you ask yourself, who am I to make  that choice? I said that before. Is it for me to play God? All   the Indonesians got together. They  elected   a   government. The   government   represents the   will   of   the   people.   Should   the  government, not in the will of the people, say, you know what? We prefer to burn coal for  another five years because our kids need electri city rather than make the switch over today.  Aren't they the right people to make the choice? Should it be me as an external banker? From  your country, Dr. Mahathir once called it "economic colonialism." So is it right for me to be  exercising economic colo nialism? So that's another dimension to this one. One, what is the right
  answer? Second, even if this is the right answer, am I the right person to be exercising this choice  on behalf of the kid in Indonesia?  Now, therefore, it's not easy. But the problem with going down that path is it's very easy to get  to a state where therefore, I should do nothing. And going back to my original thing, that I as a  representative and as a company, feel that long term, this i s a crucial issue for mankind, crucial  for a planet. I can't bury my head in the sand and do nothing either. So then you weigh the two  and say, okay what can I do that moves us in the right direction, but not in a way that necessarily  deprives all the econ omic and social welfare needs of the people in the country.  So we came to the choice saying, okay, let's get out of coal. Why? Because coal is the dirtiest. It  is the highest carbon emitter. But we also consciously said we're going to continue supporting  gas and oil because there is no replacement for it today. If   you turned off all gas and oil in the  world, you would have complete cataclysm. The Europeans are seeing that today with the gas  and oil, they have a reliance on Russia. But the underlying issue is they have reliance on gas. And  even the Europeans today, w ith all the intent to try to move to a new energy system, cannot turn  off gas because it means the people don't get heat, they don't get energy, they don't get food.  And when you sit there and somebody poor and say, okay, I'm going to trade off the climate  versus my food, energy and other basic needs, I can tell you every time where that answer is  going to be.  So then you get to a nuance saying, what can I do to move the needle without necessarily doing  tremendous harm to the social welfare needs and the economic needs of people? And there is  no hard answer to that. You got to make a nuance judgement. So you sho uld go read the work of  the lady called Kate Raworth from Oxford. She is this construct she calls “doughnut economics.”  The doughnut economics idea explains really well what I'm talking about. She says, the outside  ring of the doughnut is the SDGs, which r elate to the planetary boundaries of Mother Earth. So  ozone in the air, et cetera et cetera, you know what we need to stay within. But the inside ring  of the doughnut represents the social floors, which is hunger, poverty and the other SDGs which  relate to   standard of living. And I think she very nicely says that we've got to learn how to live in  the doughnut. We could actually squeeze the planetary boundaries and go within the inside ring,  in which case you compromise the economic and social needs of peopl e today. That's not  tenable. Equally, you could drive the economic needs of people and blow past the planetary  boundaries, the outer ring. That's not tenable either. So how do you dance around within the  two rings is the key question. That's doughnut econo mics.
  And to me the answer to that, like I said, is a nuanced answer. Today, as you think about our fossil  fuel, understanding, we got out of coal, as we did these pathways, we made the determination  that we can actually reduce our oil and gas by up to 30%, 20 o r 30% in the next 8 years in a  meaningful way, which will move the needle for society, but not create the energy security issues  and the lack of availability electricity issues that we're seeing today. This will be done by talking  to experts, talking to pe ople. So it is a judgement call that this is the right glide path to be on. Is  it 100% accurate? I don't know. Is it in the right range of what we should be trying to achieve? I  think it is.  Elaine Fernandez:  Business decision - making requires careful consideration of trade - offs and the impact these will  have on the company, society and the environment at large. Creating both profit and social value  requires businesses to think long term and integrate sustainabi lity throughout the organisation,  beginning with accounting for the risks of inaction, exploring the business opportunities  presented by focusing on societal needs and addressing the externalities in their business model.  As Piyush has highlighted, many companies such as DBS are already doing just this; charting a  new course and blazing a trail for others to follow. Their viability in the long term depends on it.

Drivers of Economic Inequality

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Sharan Burrow makes the case for centring people and the planet in all aspects of decision-making be that in governance, business models, or societal values.While business inherently carries risks, the failure to share the wealth generated from labour and profits contributes to a society where only a few benefit, leading to the dehumanising exploitation of workers, their communities, and the environment.Research shows that 94% of workers in supply chains are 'hidden', with CEOs often unaware of the exploitation, poverty wages, and unsafe conditions these workers endure.Governments, trapped in a pursuit of foreign direct investment, often accept the exploitation of their people, in exchange for 'trickle-down' wealth. This approach fails to provide sustainable development, skills enhancement, and equitable nation-building.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Drivers of Economic Inequality  Rohan Hazell :  How decisions are made at the international level and by multilateral institutions have an  impact on how countries and businesses balance growth with the wellbeing of the  environment and communities.  One   area   of   concern is   workers’ rights.   Despite   unprecedented   levels   of   prosperity  experienced by many around the world, workers continue to be exploited and marginalised,  contributing to ever - increasing global income inequality.  We speak to Sharan Burrow, former General Secretary of the International Trade Union  Confederation, the largest trade union confederation in the world, about how trade - offs are  grappled with at the international level, and what must guide decision - making a t all levels to  facilitate better levels of socioeconomic equality.  Sharan Burrow:  If we're going to reshape a world where people and planet are at the heart of all of the  thinking we do government policy and distribution, the business model itself, and of course  the way in which society thinks about both its own communities and the natu re of work,  decent work, because the dignity of decent work is in fact the very purpose for many, many  people that keeps them alive, getting up in the day, and contributing.  It is indeed a real question about why we've developed a model of business that is exploitative  of labor and is exploitative of the environment so that we take all of the profits and  accumulate them in the country of ownership of the corporations and the s upply chains that  are so dependent on the production and the productivity of workers and so dependent on  the resources and the governance of countries who are not actually sharing in the prosperity.  I talk about 94% of workers from our research being a hidden workforce in our supply chains,  the CEOs of major companies, many of whom still have no idea of what their supply chain  contractual layers look like. They are often shocked when I would take them . Stories of  exploitation, poverty, wages, yes, but unsafe work, discriminatory work, work that you  wouldn't countenance for ourselves, for our children or grandchildren and yet these are very  wealthy companies.
  Now, we all understand that business carries risks. But if you are not actually prepared to  share the wealth that we make from   labour   and from profit, then what are we creating it for?  For a very few individuals on the planet? And why are we creating on the basis of exploitation,  not just the dehumanizing exploitation for workers, but actually their communities and their  environment?  So that's the challenge. The business model has failed us, whatever you want to label it as  trickle - down   economics, you know, it has not worked. And the worst thing about this is that  it's not just causing despair for the individual, it's causing anger, and that's causing civil unrest.  And if we don't do something about it, then it leads to the conflict that   we're seeing  everywhere in the world because people don't feel secure.  There's no sense of common security. And I think we might come back to that. But my final  point about this is the business model. The investment model has also captured governments  in a   straitjacket   because they felt that their only challenge was to collect more and more FDI  or foreign direct investment, more and more international investment. And   therefore,   they  had to actually accept the exploitation of their own people with the hope that in fact there  would be wealth that would trickle down from this.  That is not an answer to a development model that actually should be leaving skills,  increasing, income distribution, a sense of building a nation from a model that works for  everybody, whether it's a developing economy, an emerging economy, or the richest   nations  in the world. So we've got work to do to rethink the economic model that works for  everybody.  Businesses fundamental, in a way, joined at the hip with business as trade union advocates  because, of course, jobs are created in the world of business, but we cannot allow the  exploitation. It means that people face a dehumanizing future not just for the mselves, but  with no hope of that being better for their children.  Rohan Hazell:  Economic models that underpin exploitative business practices are concentrating wealth in  the hands of a few and driving inequality up year on year.  A redesign of business and investment models to include fair distribution of resources,  decent work, and common security is therefore needed to enable all people to live with  dignity and have access to the basic rights to life.

Principal Objective 2: Providing the Basic Rights to Life (Part 1)

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Chandran Nair illustrated the State’s obligation to provide the basic rights to life, including healthy food, clean water, secure housing, access to education, affordable healthcare, and meaningful work.The State must ensure the availability of safe and secure food. This involves managing the complex food supply chain to provide nutritious food that is not only accessible but also safe for consumption.Access to safe and clean water, coupled with robust sanitation systems, is fundamental for public health and a thriving economy. Investments in water and sanitation infrastructure are crucial, as highlighted during the pandemic.Governments are responsible for providing secure housing and affordable energy, balancing the need for shelter with environmental sustainability. This is particularly important as the number of people living in insecure housing, like slums, is on the rise. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Principal Objective 2:  Providing the Basic Rights to Life (Part 1)  Elaine Fernandez:  The second principal objective of the state is to provide the basic rights to life.  Although an essential mandate for states, many countries around the world have yet to  overcome the challenge of meeting basic needs.  Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, will walk you through this fundamental feature of good  governance, starting with food security, clean water, and decent housing.  Chandran Nair:  The obligations of the state with regard to the basic rights of life are the following six. Healthy  food, safe and secure. Very important.  Safe and clean water, with the appropriate sanitation systems to pull it all together, then safe  and secure homes. People have that dignity and security, together with basic energy needs, then  access to education and literacy for all. That is a basic human   right. Affordable healthcare in a  world in which privatisation is essentially alienating and not allowing lots of people to have  access. And governments must intervene in this .   And last, fulfilling and meaningful work, so that  people have the ability to work, sense of purpose and contribute to the economy without  necessarily having to work in a factory.  And there are many ways that governments can intervene to do that. To do all of that, the  government must provide what we call the basic rights of life. That's primary obligation, and the  economy, the economic activities organised so that it allows that wh en the economic activity is  organised as a free for   all, which   impinges on people's basic rights to life, then the government  is essentially failing in his obligation.
  So the role of the state in the 21st century is to organise the economy, the economic activities to  fulfil the basic rights of life. The first would be, in my view, healthy food that is safe and secure.  That in itself is an extremely complex set of require ments to build that. In many countries, the  rush to modernise, to industrialise, has resulted in neglect of all of these, and that is widely  understood today. We somehow thought that if we industrialised, we could just buy our food  from a supermarket witho ut thinking that food in a supermarket has required a tremendous  journey from seed to then harvesting and then conversion and processing and transport and all  of that.  I've already referred to the fact that much of our food today is not that safe. So we will need to  get to a stage where we start to look at protecting common goods, which is safe food. The whole  food supply chain is to become safer, so that food we consume   is actually good for us rather than  bad for us. So that is an obligation of the state in terms of basic rights of life.  At the same time, food security now is a big issue, as we have all seen through the pandemic. So  the government has an obligation to make sure that the food supply chain is secure. And that  means a combination of making sure that there are different actors   in their food supply chain,  but they don't control it in ways that disenfranchises people who can't afford, et cetera. So food,  safe and secure.  The second part, and I think the pandemic has made that very clear, is safe and clean water and  sanitation. I don't need to remind everyone that in the first days of the pandemic or the first few  months, we were all told that hygiene is the most important   thing, and yet we don't invest  enough in it. The data is very clear from the developed world to the developing world.  The amount of money spent on securing safe and clean water is small compared to the  investments going into what is seen as the economy. But I will argue that safe and clean water  and sanitation are the fundamental prerequisites for our economy. If you don' t have people who  are healthy, who can go to work, and you have a deteriorating environment in terms of the water  supply, many things begin to collapse.  So the second thing that governments need to provide in terms of basic rights of life is to ensure  that people have safe, clean water supplies, which are coupled with first class sanitation systems.  Then we have safe and secure homes together with energy.  Increasingly, people live in secure housing situations, and populations of people that are exposed  to the insecurity of not having a safer boat are increasing slum populations, etc. And governments
  have a very important obligation to secure that. And with that, obviously, the need for energy  that is affordable.  But at the same time, in the world in which we are looking to reduce our carbon footprints that  don't have a large negative impact on the environment, this is a major task. But the basic rights  of every human being should be the provision of a safe roof, a nd that allows people to live with  dignity.

Managing Externalities

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the crucial role that government intervention, redesigning business models and reevaluating consumption habits have to play in managing externalities.The primary responsibility for managing externalities rests with governments, who have historically intervened to limit their damaging impacts, such as through implementing regulations on the tobacco and sugar industries.The private sector is an invaluable partner in managing externalities but must be compelled by the government to abide by rules and regulations established for the protection of private and public goods.The private sector must undergo a fundamental redesign of its business models to effectively tackle externalities, considering that traditional business practices have historically thrived on factors like pollution and exploitation of cheap labour.Consumers are also important in tackling externalities. However, their actions are shaped by government rules. These regulations can compel companies, and therefore their consumers, to behave responsibly.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Managing Externalities  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are present in almost all aspects of economic activity. Some have national and even  global implications, while most are localised enough to not be of much concern.  But who decides which externalities should be addressed, and how?  This is the question you’ll explore in this chapter, with GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair  Chandran Nair:  Well, the question about who is responsible for managing and reining in externalities, I would  argue, is kind of threefold right? At the highest level, it's up to the society and the society's  norms and rules, and that can only be through the institutions of the society. And I would call  that the state or the government. I mean, the state needs to essentially decide how we do that.  Now, that's not a new concept.  We've used the word externalities, but in many ways externalities and controlling have been the  role of the state in terms of wanting to protect public goods and common goods. So in many  ways, many of the environmental pollution laws that we have are laws to essentially limit the  damaging   impacts   of externalities, be it a pollutant, be it the social consequences, the  externalities of people driving fast on motorways without safety belts, et cetera, was addressed  when governments put in laws that said you have to wear a safety belt, and therefore the  amount of debts from accidents was reduced considerably.  Governments have intervened with the externalities to do with the tobacco industry, sugar. So  increasingly, governments are intervening. Only governments can intervene because of the  large-scale nature and the social transformation you want to bring. Then, of course, we have the  opportunity for businesses to be partners in it. But beyond the opportunities, governments  have to at times, and many times, compel businesses to abide by new rules.  
The only thing that protects you from me are rules. Those rules are not made by the private  sector. Those rules are made by the state and the social norms of a society. Businesses have an  important role to play in this, and the tension, quite very often, between regulation to reduce  and frame an externality in a way that it does not have a long term detrimental effect on  societies.  There's often a negotiation sometimes with the private interests. And when private interests are  very strong, they seek to dilute the ability of the state to act in ways that protect public and  private goods. So governments have the ultimate responsibility. Their partners in this have to be  business.   But   businesses   have   for   so   long   built   their   business   models   on   thriving   on  externalities. Be it cheap labour, pollution, social costs, whatever you can name it, they have  thrived on it.  When I talk to businesses, or when any of you in businesses think about this, you have to do a  very simple exercise. You have to look at the externalities of your business model. This is not  rocket science. You can do it rather easily. And when you do that, then you have to see in the  way you operate, be it in your own country. If you're a global company, what are the  implications of those externalities? And which ones do you take responsibility for with regard to  existing laws, or where you feel you have a moral obligation to go beyond the laws and reduce  that, and in that sense even be a leader, an innovator to change things.  So I think businesses have a very important role to play. But the experience so far has been that  businesses need governments to create the level playing field in climate change and CO2  reductions. Businesses have always hedged so far, and the plea now is, can governments create  a level playing field? so that they do not have to feel that whilst one part of a certain industry  may do it, the others don't and therefore they suffer from competitive disadvantage?  And then, of course, there are us, the individuals and the consumers. This is not an easy thing to  do because there's a tension. The tension is, of course, the private sector wanting us all to be  consumers, relentless consumers that come back to the ability to encourage us to consume by  under-pricing.  But if we have governments acting responsibly to make sure that the externalities that cannot  be tolerated have rules and regulations that then compel the private sector to act, then the  consumer is forced to also respond accordingly. Whilst we make that transition, I think  consumers have to ask themselves questions. This is quite often seen as the way to start off  
with. And I think this is naive. Many people in the developing world, the majority of consumers,  haven't even started consuming in ways that people in the more affluent societies consume.  So to make sure that they have access to resources, they have access to the goods and services  that improve their qualities of life, the governments have to essentially make sure that those  who produce those goods and services produce those in ways that they are willing to live with,  and that do not have impacts that are intolerable to the consumers, particularly those more  disenfranchised communities. So it's those three tiers, but it starts with the state.  If you're in the business and you want to be a leader for the 21st century, then you don't wait  for the rules, you start to redesign your business models. And that's the most difficult thing. And  that's that unlearning that we are asking you all to think about. We can't simply talk about  innovation without understanding this humbling fact that most of our business models thrive on  externalising true costs.  Elaine Fernandez:  The government has a mandate to manage the negative impacts of economic activity, and only  the government can set the tolerance levels for these unintended consequences. Clear rules  and regulations are therefore crucial to prevent loopholes and ensure accountability.  However, forward-thinking businesses should be encouraged not to wait for regulations but to  proactively   redesign   their   business   models   to   mitigate negative externalities, embodying  leadership for sustainable development in the 21st century.

Progress on Circular Economy in the United Arab Emirates

### keyTakeaway
This chapter discussed strategic decision-making through the lens of the UAE's focus on circular economy policies, highlighting the nation's commitment to green growth as a key driver of economic sustainability.The UAE has identified four key sectors - sustainable green manufacturing, sustainable food production and consumption, sustainable infrastructure, and sustainable transportation - as focal points for implementing circular economy policies.The UAE has decided to invest significantly in green transitions both domestically and internationally, emphasising renewable energy projects and supporting developing countries' transitions.Governance of the new focus on circular economic development has involved the private sector to get multiple viewpoints on best practices.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Progress on Circular Economy in the United Arab Emirates  Rohan Hazell :  Facilitating sustainable transformation isn’t easy. It involves diverse stakeholders across a  range of sectors and industries.  So how do decision - makers move forward when faced with such complexity and high stakes?  What are the key factors for successful cross - sector collaboration and multi - stakeholder  engagement?  To provide insight on these questions, you’ll hear from His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al  Marri, Minister of Economy for the United Arab Emirates and former Secretary General of the  UAE Cabinet.  His Excellency will speak about the UAE’s ambitions for moving from a linear economy to a  circular economy.  A linear economy is defined by resource extraction, production, distribution, use, and  disposal. Meanwhile a circular economy attempts to decouple from the consumption of finite  resources   –   this means it uses sustainable inputs and renewable resources; it   also recycles  resources and products instead of disposing them; and lastly, it minimises waste and negative  externalities.  H.E. Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri:  If we go back moreover, specifically in the circular economic policies, one of my roles back in  2012 and 2011, supported the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al  Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and the Ruler of Dub ai back then  to start developing and launching the UAE Green Growth Strategy in 2012.  This is a major focus on how the UAE really thought about and the thinking behind, you know,  green growth and circularity in this economy.  When the Scale 360 was signed, we did a quick analysis before signing it to understand why  we should sign a circular economy initiative globally. And with that research then we  understood that actually the UAE has a huge private sector that's really involv ed in circularity.
  That actually can push forward a lot of what we do. And when we started looking at  incorporating the circular initiatives in urban areas, and we   could understand that there is  huge research   that we can result in 138 billion dollar savings in the GCC by 2030, which is  equivalent to 1% of the region’s cumulative GDP. And this is according to a recent study by  PWC.  So the policy aims to minimize natural resources consumption and reduce waste and ensure  quality of life for current and future generations. With Covid 19 impact in 2020, we saw from  day one, oil and gas went down. We saw tourism go down. We saw the Aviati on industry  going down, and these are the key pillars of the UAE’s economy.  And our task was as well to look at how we can come out of the Covid 19 and to look at how  we can initiate new economic growth and new economic sectors. Circular economy is a huge  aspect where we can really provide for that. So the policy is where we aim t o minimize the  natural   resource   consumption,   and   we   have   key   objectives,   including   promoting  environmental health, supporting the private sector, and adopting clean production methods  and reducing natural environmental stress and raising awareness within t he society  We looked at the aspect of creating some governance to things. One of the most important  parts of this governance aspect is we managed to create the UAE Circular Economy Council  then from that as well, which I'm a vice chair and the chairman is the Ministe r of Climate  Change and Environment.  From that council we derived as well, because I love policy. We could derive the Circular  Economy Policy Committee, which I   chair,   and the members of this policy committee is private  sector cause we believed in the UAE as well, that if we want this to be successful, the policy  should be derived from a bottom up approach through the policy sector.  With that said as well, we managed to develop about 22 policies over the last nine months  through the, the council, we have a council meeting now, circular economy council meeting  happening this week to approve the, the way forward. We had a very strong ro admap. And  all the private sector really says as well to us that we're very happy to see that the UAE is  pushing forward heavily on the aspects of circular economy drive through the leadership and  actually seeing impact on the ground.  We're investing heavily in the green transition here at home, 40 billion dollars and then in 70  other countries around the globe, 17 billion dollars to help them in their transition through  innovative partnership and projects, and we plan to invest another   50 billion dollars in the  next decade. I should point out as well that the big part of this amount is private finance.  Several UAE organizations such as Master and AMEA Power are investing in renewable  projects at large scale all over the world, particularly in developing countries. The UAE
  committed 400 million dollars to enable the transition to pay energy for developing countries  that will positively impact a hundred million African citizens by 2035.  This amount served to establish the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing, the ETAF  platform, a new global climate finance facility to accelerate the transition to renewable  energy in developing countries. The UAE also committed the 400 million dollars i n funding  provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for development toward the platform goal of securing a  minimum of 1 billion dollars in total funding.  We also pledge to raise 4 billion dollars to invest in technology that will transform agriculture,  food production to limit climate change. Moreover, we have recently joined a multi - country  alliance, spearheaded by the International Renewable Energy Agency   (IRENA) and the India  headquartered   International Solar Alliance   (ICA) to deliver and   diversify global solar  manufacturing supply chains.  And at the same time, investment in renewables can be as beneficial to us here in the UAE as  it's for other countries that we're investing in. The dividends of such project are significant.  And I'm talking financially.  Despite the relatively high risk, beyond the contribution, these projects are made to climate  change mitigation, a public good, which benefits virtually everyone on the planet. And the  component systems required for solar and wind projects could also be so urced locally and  hence support our manufacturing factories.  This includes production line, tower manufacturing, processes, cables, connection boxes,  transformers, and the need to implement for building foundations.  So the principle and the discipline that is used is to use resources efficiently and without waste  while limiting negative externalities. So you can see the circle economy approach fits very well  under the principle and the circle economy is a key to reduc e greenhouse gas emission,  optimize the use of raw and waste material, which will enhance agriculture productivity,  conceptually decrease negative externality associated with the linear economy.  And the UAE has focused on the use of renewable energy and diversification away from fossil  fuels. This is now we are moving into the kind of the energy transition period, and through  defining the processes and regulatory framework for reusing and demateri alizing materials  and goods. And three, the reuse of waste and recycling processes.  In order to maximize the positive effects on the UAE economy, we have identified four priority  sector circular economy policy approaches, like mentioned   before:   sustainable green  manufacturing, sustainable food production consumption, sustainable infrastructure, and  sustainable transportation.
  Four sectors combined represent the largest share of the economy, and therefore could have  the most significant potential to try the circularity in the country. Opportunities related to  circularity are analysed within each sector to understand the negative   externalities such as  the land use, soil, water, and air pollution in order to be better managed, along with the  emission of toxic substances and GHGs that are scoped in the net zero strategy.  Rohan Hazell:  His Excellency has shared the UAE’s approach to redesigning its economy and encouraging  transformation beyond its borders in the Middle East and North Africa.  In doing so he emphasised the importance of thorough research and robust governance  structures for effective stakeholder engagement and collaboration with the private sector.

Leveraging CSOs for Transformative Public Policymaking

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, KAM Morshed illustrated how civil society can serve as the intermediary between governments and their populations to drive a community-led, need-responsive approach to development.Governments often face challenges in responding to public opinions, especially those from marginalised communities, due to the lack of clear channels for communication and engagement with these communities.CSOs can serve as intermediaries who can translate the needs and problems expressed by marginalised communities into actionable policy responses.Rather than imposing solutions crafted by external experts without consulting the communities they aim to serve, CSOs can help governments understand and respond to the specific demands and challenges articulated by those directly affected.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Leveraging CSOs for   Transformative Public Policymaking  Host:  It is being increasingly recognised that   top - down government policymaking does not always meet  the needs of the people and communities involved.  So how can   governments leverage bottom - up policymaking? This is where civil society  organisations come in. CSOs have a deep understanding of the marginalised groups they   serve  and   can act as a voice for their often overlooked needs.  You’ll hear from Mr. Kam Morshed, Senior Director of BRAC an international development  organisation that works with marginalised communities across Asia and Africa.  Mr. Morshed will explain how CSOs can use their connections with the grassroots to influence  and shape public policy with the best interests of the most vulnerable and marginalised in mind.  KAM Morshed:  Not always easy for the government to react to public opinions because the public opinions,  when public, especially people living in the margin, express their priority. They're not codified.  They're not. You know, it's very difficult to ask the government   that this is the policy that we are  trying to formulate. What do you think about it?  Because people living in hard - to - reach areas or people fighting adversity, for them, reacting to a  policy which is already formulated is almost impossible. So, they need an intermediary who can  work with the people, find out what are the problems they want   to be solved and then do the  analysis whether this policy response is going to solve it or whether the policy response needs to  be different to solve the problem.  So, you almost need a translator who can codify what people need and want, what problem  needs to be solved and then translate that into what policy responses are required. So here, by  being present in the grassroots, work with the people, knowing what the y're facing day in, day  out and translating that to the government in a codified form by governments in Bangladesh. So ,
  this is what we do. Sometimes we also take part in, I would say, some activism that is   often  needed   because a country like Bangladesh has thousands of priorities.  Now, the government also needs to know which one they are going to address first, which one is  critical and for which there is no, you know, if there is a problem associated with the   business  community . There are established channels where the business community can raise their voice.  But when it comes to, say accessibility of disability inclusion, the channels are not very clear. So ,  NGOs or NGOs as a community, can then work together to amplify the voice, amplify the issue  and raise it to the respective government agencies or government organisation to deal with. So ,  for example, child marriage is something that is a huge social problem still in Bangladesh. So,  BRAC is not only part of various NGO coalition that works on the issue, supports the victim, but  also advocates with local government for certain enforcement.  We are also part of the national committee to eliminate child marriage, where we discuss and  coordinate all these activities of both government, private sector and public sector and NGOs.  So ,   we are part of these mechanisms. Again, our role is, the way we see it is to codify the  priorities, the knowledge, the insights from the ground to the government so that they can  readily use it for reflection in the policies. We firmly believed and acted   on the belief that people  in calamities   are in the best position to tell or to determine how to get over these challenges that  they are facing. So when we started, each of the programmes were based on specific demand  coming from the people we are working with.  We, unlike many other NGO, our pilots are not designed by a university or an expert group. Our  projects are not influenced by some global debate. So, it's always the demand comes from the  field that, okay, in such and such location, people are finding it   difficult to sustain because  the productivity of the soil is going down and they don't have any alternative livelihood options.  So, we are now working with some of the big knowledge partners to develop adaptation centre.  So, this is a one - stop service centre in the locality where people can come and talk about their  challenge and this person can facilitate and expose them to various models that other countries  might have tried. So that this person with difficulty can have   ideas and then say, okay, I'm going  to do this. And then we have a discussion around what BRAC can do to help. So our 17  programmes are, you know, it's not part of a grand jigsaw puzzle because we don't have a grand  solution to the development challenge. A nd I think this is particularly because this is more  common among Southern NGOs, NGOs who started in the South, originated in the South.  Because if you're a Southern NGO, if you're BRAC established in Bangladesh, you have to admit
  that you don't have all the solutions. Because if you had all the solutions, Bangladesh wouldn't  have been where it is now. You know, it would have been already a developed country.  So, I think this humility of the Southern development approach enabled us to be needs -  responsive and not top - down, which I think one of the reasons why BRAC cannot be irrelevant,  because to be irrelevant, the decision needs to be taken by people who do not   or who are not  facing the problem. That's not happening in BRAC.  Host:  Given that policymakers can   be removed   from challenges of the average individual, it can be  difficult to create public policy that adequately addresses people's needs, or for marginalised  groups to have their voices heard.  Lived experience is an essential component of designing solutions for the marginalised. Any effort  to help socioeconomically disadvantaged communities should include those who have first - hand  knowledge of the hardships they face.  This is where, to use Mr. Morshed's apt description, CSOs can step in to act as 'translators', to  first codify the wants and needs of people at the grassroots and then communicate these insights  to the government.

Markets and Trade: Implications of the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani explored the pivotal role the economic development of Asian societies has played in shaping the emergence of the post-Western world.Successful development of Asian societies, particularly China, India, and ASEAN, is driving global economic growth and prosperity. For example, the economic contributions of ASEAN in the past decade have exceeded those of the European Union. With the middle-class population in these regions expanding significantly, there are abundant opportunities for SMEs and individuals worldwide to tap into new markets.Even with the economic benefits brought by the growth of Asian markets, there are challenges evident in US-China relations. Yet, despite challenges and tariffs, trade between the two nations has continued to grow.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Markets and Trade: Implications of the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  For centuries, the West has dominated global trade and shaped international markets. But the  rise of economic powerhouses in the East is already disrupting the status quo, reshaping trade  dynamics and challenging past hierarchies.  Just take China's Belt and Road Initiative, fostering new trade corridors and bypassing traditional  Western-led structures as a sign of things to come.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani, former President of the UN Security Council, and Distinguished  Fellow at the Asian Research Institute, shares more about the economic implications of a  multipolar world.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  Well, I think as you move into the post-Western world, it's important to emphasise that this  post-Western world is a result of the successful development initially, especially of many Asian  societies. And the successful development of the new Asian societies is going to create greater  global growth and prosperity.  In fact, I believe when you ask what it means for the ordinary citizen, for the SMEs, what it  means is new markets for their products, new opportunities for them to grow and thrive. And I  believe that the future growth in the 21st century will be driven by the new CIA. Now, CIA  doesn't stand for the Central Intelligence Agency. The new CIA stands for China, India and  ASEAN. And let me give you one statistic that illustrates how much of the global economic  growth is going to come from the new CIA.  Because in the year 2000, the total middle class population of China, India and ASEAN was only  150 million in the year 2000. But by 2020, the total middle class population of CIA had grown  ten times to 1.5 billion, and by 2030, it could reach 3 billion. Now, a world in which you have 3  billion new members of the middle class means tremendous new opportunities for SMEs or  individuals who are looking for markets for their products.  
So it's important to emphasise therefore, that the return of Asia and the transition to a  post-Western world is actually a better world for people all over the world, and by the way,  including for people in Europe and in the United States because it creates greater opportunities  for them also to grow their businesses with the growth and development of the new CIA -  China, India and ASEAN. So far, fortunately, even though the United States has stepped up its  geopolitical contest against China, trade between the US and China has actually grown.  And indeed, despite the tariffs that the United States has put on Chinese products, as President  Joe Biden said in his 2019 election campaign for the presidency, these tariffs that the United  States has put on China have hurt American workers, American consumers and the American  economy, right? And that's why I think it'd be wiser for President Joe Biden to heed his own  words and lift these tariffs on China. But the remarkable thing is that despite the fact that these  tariffs on China have not been lifted, Chinese exports to the United States have actually grown.  Therefore, I actually believe that the whole world should welcome the resurgence of the  Chinese market, the resurgence of the Indian market and the ASEAN markets because this will  provide a lot of economic growth to the world. And let me give you one stunning statistic so  that people understand what I mean. In the year, if you add up the total GNP of European Union  countries, it comes to 15 trillion and ASEAN is only 3 trillion.  Yet in the last ten years, if you ask a simple question: Did the European Union contribute more  to global economic growth or did ASEAN contribute more to global economic growth? And the  answer is that ASEAN contributed more to global economic growth than the European countries  did. And this shows you the power of the emergence of these Asian economies. And that's why,  frankly, we should all welcome this development and work to strengthen it instead of resisting  the return and resurgence of Asia.  Rohan Hazell:  The emergence of the post-Western world is largely a result of the economic development of  Asian societies, including China, India and ASEAN.  Western powers have held reservations at this emerging reality as we have seen with the US  trade war with China. However, the resurgence of these markets will drive much of the growth  and prosperity we will see around the world in the years to come.

Cross-Sector Opportunities: Civil Society and Business

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Karim Rushdy highlighted the imperative for collaboration between civil society and business, emphasising the necessity of mutual benefit and sustainability.Civil society organisations possess strengths like grassroots trust and expertise, offering valuable insights and support to businesses in market research, product development, and service delivery.Civil society acts as a counterbalance against the negative impacts of business activities, using pressure groups, consumer advocacy, and think tanks to raise awareness and monitor practices.Consumer advocacy groups ensure product safety and ethical practices, while think tanks provide independent insights into socio-political and economic trends, benefiting businesses and policymakers in decision-making.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Cross-Sector Opportunities: Civil Society and Business  Host:  The objectives of civil society organisations may often seem at odds or even in direct conflict  with business goals.  But how true is this, really? After all, civil society members and supporters may also be business  stakeholders. They might be current or potential customers, partners, suppliers or employees.  What, then, are the opportunities available for business to draw on the strengths and influence  of CSOs? In return, how can CSOs collaborate with business in mutually beneficial ways?  To answer these questions, we’ll hear from Karim Rushdy, former managing director of GIFT and  advisor to GIFT.ed.  Karim Rushdy:  So I think it's really critical that any collaboration between any two sectors, but in particular civil  society and business, this collaboration needs to be mutually beneficial. So if business is  thinking of partnering with civil society just to look good, just to improve its reputation, then  that's   probably   not   going   to   fly   and   it's   probably   not   going   to   be   a   very   sustainable  collaboration.  But if business thinks a little bit deeper and looks at some of the strengths of civil society, there  are many opportunities for collaboration which can be mutually beneficial, which can really be  good for business as well. I mean, civil society is at the grassroots. It has the trust of the  communities, the vulnerable groups that it serves, that it works with. And these communities  are often out of reach for business.  So if companies are looking to launch a new product or a new service, for example, civil society  can support when it comes to market research. What does the customer really need? What  does the customer really want? Helping companies to conduct focus groups in the community  with people that do trust civil society, but for whom are at arm's length when it comes to  
business. Civil society also has a lot of strengths that business can leverage. So trust of the  communities in which it operates is one.  But civil society organisations also have great expertise in the areas that they work on. They've  often been working for decades, if not longer, on a specific issue, on a specific topic. So within  those organisations, the expertise around that issue are really, really high, and business can  draw upon those expertise for insights as well, when it comes to helping civil society further its  own goals.  Take for example, a civil society organisation that is trying to promote financial inclusion  amongst rural communities. They know that these rural communities need access to certain  financial services and products, micro insurance, for example, to protect them against shocks.  But if there are no products and services available for those rural communities, it becomes very  difficult for them to enter into the formal financial system. So in an instance like that, the civil  society organisation could go and partner with a large financial services provider, an insurance  company and work together, collaborate right from the market research, to the product  development side, to the rollout of that product and make those services, make those products  accessible within the community. Business wins. It's expanding its customer base; it's selling  more of whatever it provides. The community wins because it's getting access to products and  services that it actually needs and that can support their livelihoods. And of course, the civil  society organisation benefits by its mission being furthered.  There are a few different ways that civil society can act as this check-and-balance, this honest  broker when it comes to business and government, but particularly business. I want to share  three areas that civil society plays a role, acting as a check-and-balance. Black Lives Matter,  Extinction Rebellion, there are many other such movements in the world today that really push  for change on important issues.  So when it comes to climate, when it comes to income inequality, when it comes to racial  discrimination, when it comes to things like solving the plastic waste issue, any negative  externality that is being generated through a certain business activity, that's where civil society  pressure groups can come into play. They can raise awareness, they can mobilise people, get  people out onto the streets, work with the media to make sure that articles and stories are put  out there and people get a much better understanding of these issues, and hopefully end up  feeling as passionate about these issues as they do, and then help to push for change.  So pressure groups is one example.  
Another, a little bit more mundane but equally important, is consumer advocacy groups. So  consumer watchdogs, NGOs and organisations that have a keen eye on how companies are  producing, selling and disposing of their products and services. So making sure those products  are safe for use, whether they're electrical products or foodstuffs that we may eat, making sure  they're not going to cause us any harm, making sure that companies are not, particularly  financial services companies, for example, are not engaging in predatory practices, predatory  lending, false advertising, mis-selling products and services.  So consumer advocacy is another key area. And a third would be something we also mentioned  earlier, which is think tanks. So we talked about providing independent perspective and  independent insight into socio political trends, into economic trends. And this is really a key role  for think tanks around the world. They research trends in economics, in technology and in  politics, and then not only support business by informing those business leaders of what's going  on.  And business leaders would often use reports and insights from think tanks when it comes to  decision makers. But they're also helping to inform policymakers, they're helping to inform the  government and providing insights to them as well as to the general public. So translating  sometimes very complex concepts and ideas and trends into something that we can consume  and understand and then act upon in our lives.  Host:  CSOs, by virtue of often operating at the grassroots level, holds the trust of the communities  and vulnerable groups they serve.  This means that a mutually beneficial collaboration with business can lead to opportunities like  market research, building trust with stakeholders, and utilising civil society's expertise to  improve the development and delivery of products and services.  Businesses can work to identify these opportunities not just for their immediate benefit, but  also because civil society can act as a check-and-balance, as we see with pressure groups,  consumer advocacy associations, and even think tanks. Collaborating with civil society to avoid  common pitfalls of doing business can be invaluable for building goodwill and preventing  reputational damage.  
Of course, the opportunity for partnership with civil society is not exclusive to business.  Government and media also have important roles to play in multi stakeholder collaboration, as  we’ll explore in the next chapter.

Mitigation Strategies to Prevent Overusing Fresh Water

### keyTakeaway
Safeguarding all aspects of the water cycle requires governments and businesses to work together to protect water resources, ensure equitable access, and promote sustainable consumption patterns.Strategies for mitigating the overuse of freshwater focus on three main approaches: proper pricing, developing efficient water supply infrastructure, and implementing robust water-efficiency standards.Correctly pricing water to reflect its true cost encourages conservation and equitable access, helping to reduce wastage and overconsumption.Investing in efficient infrastructure and applying water-efficiency standards are crucial for sustainable water management and reducing environmental impact.

  TRANSCRIPT  M itigation Strategies to Prevent Overusing Fresh Water  Olivia Lai:   Mitigation strategies   for stresses on freshwater in volve protecting all aspects of  the   water cycle and reducing the amount of water that is extracted in the first place.  Adaptation measures, on the other hand, involve adjusting to the reality that we simply do  not have enough fresh water to consume as we cu rrently are.  With regard to freshwater overuse, there are three main approaches that governments and  businesses can focus on. These are pricing, development of proper water conservation  infrastructure, and deploying water efficiency standard s. All of these are mitigation strategies.  Let's talk about pricing. Freshwater is severely under - priced in almost all societies around the  world, and this means it is easily overconsumed or wasted. Correct pricing starts with  establishing the true cost of water. This means factoring in protection   of resources, sourcing,  treating raw and contaminated water, and distributing it, as well as the cost of maintaining  infrastructure.  Extraction of water also leads to costs on the environment and people alike, and these  externalities should be factored into the true cost where appropriate. For example, in 2010,  Coca - Cola had its license to operate revoked for one of its factories in Ker ala, India ,   because  it was extracting up to 1.5 million litres of freshwater a day. Yet ,   it paid just $10 per 1000 litres  contributing to a   105 - meter   drop in groundwater levels in just three years. This damaged  habitats and the livelihoods of farmers alike .  Establishing the true cost of water will make it easier to enact policies such as volumetric  pricing, which charges users based on the volume of water they consume. It also makes  progressive pricing more impactful in which users are charged based on their   ability to pay  with higher prices for higher income households or businesses. This can help ensure that  water is affordable for low - income households while discouraging excessive water usage.  Second is the development of proper freshwater supply infrastructure from extraction and  treatment to distribution. Now, it might be tempting to talk about high - end technologies such  as desalinisation plants, which convert seawater into freshwater. But the   reality is these  technologies are simply not financially viable to meet the freshwater demands of humanity,  especially in large low - income countries. Not to mention the fact that they're very   carbon  intensive .  Instead, governments should invest in getting the basics right by developing high - quality  freshwater supply management infrastructure. Proper infrastructure would include efficient
  extraction to minimise pollutants from entering the system, and distribution systems would  be well - maintained to minimise leakage. At the point of use, there would be accurate water  metering provided by utility companies with government oversight. So, households and small  businesses know how much water they're consuming and what they need to pay. Busine sses  can also play a role by drawing on government incentives to build and operate these systems.  For example, the city of Ho Chi Min h   in Vietnam reformed its water infrastructure in 2014 and  saved half of the water that was previously being lost to leakage, which is enough water to  serve around 500,000 people.  Third, robust water - efficiency standards should be deployed by governments and industry  associations. These are guidelines and requirements that aim to reduce the amount of water  used without compromising on outcomes and may involve test procedures and cer tification  criteria to ensure compliance. Most obviously, this would apply for domestic and industry use,  such as water - using appliances and plumbing fixtures like water used per flush of a toilet.  But for real impact, these standards should be applied to land - use planning, agriculture, and  industry. If towns and cities are planned with water efficiency in mind, tens of thousands of  people can reduce their water usage. Equally, as agriculture uses th e most freshwater of any  human activity, it is important for governments and civil societies to help industrial agriculture  and farmers learn how to conserve water, and in the process, improve their yields.  Lastly, industries that use large amounts of water such as soft drinks, textiles, or automotive  manufacturing   –   should be incentivised through pricing models to minimise their water use  and to spur innovation to improve water efficiency.  Mitigation strategies to prevent freshwater consumption are well established. However,  freshwater is clearly taken for granted. Governments in most parts of the world are only just  taking steps in the right direction to efficiently use freshwater, and it i s imperative that  businesses are incentivised to support governments in the process of protecting resources,  pricing water, building robust infrastructure, and applying efficiency standards.

Risk Factors for the Next Pandemic 

### keyTakeaway
This chapter focused on the increasing risk factors for pandemics and highlights the lack of global preparedness for such outbreaks, despite the clear need for robust mitigation and adaptation strategies.Modernisation and climate change escalate the risk of pandemics by increasing human-animal contact and spreading disease vectors like mosquitoes, necessitating proactive health and urban planning strategies.Antibiotic resistance and the potential for superbugs represent a critical public health challenge, underscoring the importance of responsible antibiotic use and research to prevent future pandemics.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  R isk Factors for the Next Pandemic  Rohan Hazell:  In 2018, a panel of experts convened by the World Health Organisation put together a list of  major diseases with few countermeasures. It featured a hypothetical   D isease X, which would  emerge where people had encroached on wildlife habitats. This disease would be more  deadly than   influenza but   would spread just as easily between people and across global travel  networks.  Less than two years after the report was published,   D isease X turned up as C OVID - 19, which  we were all impacted by. It changed the nature of governance in many countries ,   and raised  questions about the individual rights of citizens when collective welfare was at risk. It also  altered the nature of global business and of social interactions ,   as well as testing healthcare  systems around the world.  What does this tell us? Well, it shows us two things. First, although we have a good  understanding of communicable diseases and of the risk factors that lead to their evolution  into epidemics and pandemics, there is still a lot we do not understand. This c reates great risk  for populations, especially during the early stages when new diseases are first being  identified.  Second, our economies and societies are still not adequately prepared to deal with epidemics  and pandemics, especially given the experience of   COVID - 19 . R esearchers estimate we  currently face a 2% chance of a C OVID - 19 - like pandemic in any given year. This is thankfully a  slim likelihood, but we should not allow for a false sense of security to prevent us from  improving our understanding of the risk factors that lead to the spread of communicable  diseases ,   or from developing robust mitigation and adaptation   strategies to manage them  better.  So, what are the major risk factors behind the rise of epidemics and pandemics? The first  aspect to examine is their source. All communicable diseases ,   from flu to measles ,   come from  the spread of microorganisms like bacteria and viruses. We call microorganisms that spread  disease pathogens. When one pathogen jumps from one species to another species, it can  exploit that new host's lack of   defences   and cause illness. When a pathogen jumps from an  animal into humans, it is called a zoonotic disease. This is   important to know because three  out of every four new infectious diseases come from animals and cause 2.7 million deaths a  year.
  COVID - 19 was a zoonotic disease, and the next pandemic is likely to be as well. Pathogens can  infect humans directly through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected animal or  indirectly through food, water, and other materials that have been contamin ated with  pathogens.  The risk of zoonotic diseases occurring is rising for several reasons. The illegal wildlife trade is  an obvious example as it puts humans into contact with rare animals and their unfamiliar  pathogens. Unregulated wildlife markets also have poor sanitary co nditions ,   making it easier  for diseases to spread. But even regulated agriculture can lead to zoonotic disease spreading,  particularly with modern industrial agriculture. Animals are often packed together in  unsanitary conditions, making it very easy for p athogens to jump back and forth and mutate ,  becoming even more infectious to humans.  Climate change can also affect the spread of infectious diseases by allowing or forcing disease -  spreading animals to enter new habitats. In fact, a study in the science journal in nature  showed that over half of infectious diseases have become aggravated b y climate change. For  example, mosquitoes are spreading from the equator by around 4.7   kilometres   every year for  the past century due to rising global temperatures. This allows them to spread malaria into  new populations, a disease which is already respons ible for the deaths of over 600,000 people  every year.  The modernisation of societies across the world also increases the risk of zoonotic diseases  spreading. We've already spoken about industrial agricultural practices, but the risks also  extend to how people live in the modern era. As human populations grow,   previously wild  areas become deforested and settled. This brings people into contact with sources of  infection they would not otherwise have encountered, and having encountered these  pathogens, it is also now much easier to pass them on.  For example, modern transportation of people, animals, and food means that a disease can  quickly make its way to a local metropolis, and courtesy of lorries, trains, and planes to almost  anywhere else in the world. We saw this   first - hand   with C OVID - 19, where even the isolated  Chatham Islands, which lie 800 kilometres east of New Zealand, recorded Covid cases after  two years of avoiding the virus.  With modernisation also comes urbanisation. Today, some 56% of the world's population ,   or  4.4 billion people ,   live in cities. In many cases, towns and cities have high population densities  that have never before occurred in human history. When people live in such close proximity,  diseases can spread more easily through respiratory droplets ,   or from contact with  contaminated food and water.  Unfortunately, it is often poorer communities that are worst impacted by the drawbacks of  crowded living spaces or poor urban planning. In fact,   poorly managed   urbanisation in many  parts of the world has also led to poor living conditions with inadequate sanitation and lack
  of access to healthcare systems, which naturally accelerates the spread of pathogens. Certain  disease vectors like rats and mosquitoes make this worse.  Modernisation has also led to the proliferation of antibiotic use for both animals and humans,  which is increasing antibiotic resistance. Now, this is a serious public health concern that  occurs when bacteria evolved to become resistant to the antibiotics   designed to treat them.  It has been predicted that by 2050, up to 10 million people a year could be killed by  antimicrobial resistant bacteria.  Antibiotic resistance can also lead to the emergence of superbugs or bacteria that are  resistant to multiple antibiotics, making them extremely difficult to treat. If a superbug were  to cause a pandemic, it could be much more deadly and difficult to contro l than other  infectious diseases, being able to spread from person to person with ease and even avoid  detection.  And of course, there is the risk of superbugs emerging as a result of uncontrolled or  unregulated research and development. Thousands of labs across the world are studying  pathogens ,   in most cases for justifiable medical reasons. But the risk of microorganisms  escaping is never zero. In virolog y   in particular, gain - of - function research is practiced, which  broadly speaking, enhances viruses to make them more infectious. Now, this is usually  employed with the intention of better understanding future pandemics , but there are obvious  concerns about biosafety and even weaponising such research. Needless to say, this type of  research came under close scrutiny during the   COVID - 19 pandemic.  Overall, the risk factors that lead to epidemics and pandemics are well - known, but many of  them stem from processes that we are not willing or able to yet control, such as climate  change or antibiotic resistance.

The Need to Reset Economic Goals

### keyTakeaway
We learned how the discord between the goals of our current economic paradigm and the requirements for a sustainable future must be reconciled if planetary and societal wellbeing is to be safeguarded.Given that the sheer scale of human activity, driven by our current economic paradigm, is adversely affecting the planet, it is imperative that humanity’s economic goals be reframed to place commensurate importance on societal and planetary wellbeing, alongside economic growth.The undertaking of any economic endeavour must be planned and executed within planetary boundaries, while accounting for equitable resource distribution, instead of on the presumption of endless resources and zero downstream repercussions.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Need to Reset Economic Goals  Elaine Fernandez:  History teaches us that in any given society, the structure and goals of the economy will have a  tremendous impact on that society’s development and wellbeing.  And as we now live in what scientists call the Anthropocene, or “era of humans”, it's increasingly  important that we heed these lessons, because in a globalised world the ramifications of our  economic pursuits impact not just individual nations, but humanity at large.  To provide more insight, let's hear from one of the world’s leading ecological economists at the  Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London, Professor. Robert Costanza.  Professor Costanza will share his thoughts on why a sustainable future necessitates a drastic  reimagining of the purpose, structure and goals of our economies.  Professor Robert Costanza:  I think that the fundamental problem is that we've set the wrong goals for the economy and we  fail to recognise that the economy is embedded in society, which is embedded in the rest of  nature.   And   to   recognise   that   we   are   all part of this complex, interdependent system,  particularly now in what's been called the Anthropocene epoch, or the magnitude of the human  influence on our life support system, on the functioning of the biophysical world, but also the  functioning of the social world, are much more interdependent and highly interconnected.  So I think we need to fundamentally change our view of what economics is and what it's about  and what it's for. I think we need to reestablish that the purpose of the economy is to provide a  prosperous, sustainable, equitable, high quality of life for the majority of people on the planet.  And that's going to require that we recognise that interdependence and we think about the  health and quality of the rest of nature as well. Not just humans, but all the species that we  share the planet with.  I think we've known the solutions for many decades. So the question then becomes, why, why  haven't we made more progress? What's holding us back? And how do we make this transition  happen before it's too late? Because I think we are at a critical point in the evolution of  
humanity and the evolution of the earth, and it could end up in a very bad situation. And  certainly the history of civilisations has shown us that they do collapse routinely. If anything,  that's the rule rather than the exception. So can we take a different course? Can we create a  world that's more to our liking and is more sustainable and desirable?  You we need a new development paradigm, and that paradigm should be based on wellbeing  rather than on growth per se. And that wellbeing requires that the vast majority of the  population have a secure livelihood, access to food and water and shelter and education and et  cetera. I see no reason why that should be impossible. I think the reason that we're not getting  that is because of the old development paradigm. It's growth at all costs and we're not really  worried about how that growth is distributed, we're not worried about the sustainability of it.  We need a much more ecological approach to economics that does take all of those things into  consideration. That whole idea needs to be rethought and that we need to bring distribution  much more to the centre of the goals, rather than being something that's given lip service at  best.  In a conventional paradigm, it's “Oh yeah, we'll make the pie bigger and then we'll figure out  how to split it up.” In fact, that's backwards. I think basically we have to start with how do we  stay within planetary boundaries and then how do we distribute our abundant, relatively  abundant wealth and resources in a way that's fair and equitable and that basically can support  the majority of the population. And then once we've done that, then we can start thinking  about how to, how to efficiently allocate those resources. So the conventional model has kind of  got it backward.  You could argue that in the past, when this model was being developed, specifically in the the  post World War II period, that the limiting factor was probably rebuilding the built capital  infrastructure that had been destroyed during the war but those days are long past and the  limiting factors now, I think, are our social and our natural capital. And the other way of looking  at it too, is that the natural evolution of things on earth is for organisms to grow for a while, but  then to level off and stop growing in physical terms, but can continue to improve in quality  terms. And I think that's the condition that we are in now, or at least should be in to recognise  that the physical growth in magnitude of population, of resource use, extraction, et cetera,  needs to level off and need to refocus more on distribution, on quality of life, on well being, and  make that our fundamental goal rather than growth.  Elaine Fernandez:  As Professor Costanza has shared, we are now at a pivotal moment in history, where human  activities are significantly impacting the Earth's ecosystems and geology.  
In recent years, we've seen how commercial deforestation, both legal and illegal, has claimed  17% of the Amazon rainforest, one of the world's most important carbon sinks. For humanity to  survive this era, we’ll need to leave the old, extractive economic models behind.  While trickle-down economics and “growth at all costs” have improved the lives of many, these  paradigms are ill-suited to a globalised and interconnected world, especially in addressing the  existential threats of our time.  Instead, our approach to the economy, and its purpose, should be one that prioritises the  wellbeing   of   societies,   the   equitable   distribution   of   resources,   and   safeguarding   the  environment.

Assessing the West’s Role in the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani emphasised the role of the West in the forthcoming post-Western world, underscoring the imperative for it to adjust to this evolving geopolitical landscape.While the multilateral rules-based order must be preserved, the UN Security Council must be reformed to include emerging powers like India, Brazil, Nigeria, and South Africa to retain legitimacy and reflect contemporary global dynamics.The West must learn from the causes of past conflicts - like the punitive sanctions imposed on Germany post-World War I or the alienation of Russia post-Cold War - and address contemporary underlying structural issues that could spark future conflicts.Where the United States’ approach to international relations is somewhat insulated due to its geographical distance from the rest of the world, European nations, due to its proximity with the Middle East, Asia and Africa, must adopt a more realistic geopolitical approach.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Assessing the West’s Role in the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  The term post-Western world can be misleading in that it seemingly implies the West’s role in  the coming era will be minimal.  However,   many   of   the   multilateral   institutions,   political   norms,   and   cultural   influences  established by the West will continue to shape the world, even as power dynamics shift.  How the West engages with the changing world will therefore profoundly influence the  trajectory of the future.  But it is equally important to recognise that the West in itself is not a monolith, and differences  in geography and sociopolitics will dictate how North America and Europe will navigate a  multipolar world.  To shed more light on this, let’s hear from Professor Kishore Mahbubani, former President of  the UN Security Council, and Distinguished Fellow at the Asian Research Institute.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  I think it's very important that we must strengthen and preserve the United Nations and the  multilateral rules-based order that also includes the UN Security Council. The Security Council  today faces a major strategic dilemma. It can either keep its current composition of five  permanent   member   states,   or   it   can   strengthen   its   credibility.   Because   if   it   keeps   the  composition and doesn't include new emerging powers like India, like Brazil, like Nigeria or  South Africa, then the UN Security Council will lose its credibility.  In fact, I have argued quite provocatively that India can actually undermine the UN Security  Council by just declaring that it will no longer obey the decisions of the UN Security Council.  And India is big enough to make such a statement. So if the United States, Russia, China and  Europe want to preserve the credibility of the UN Security Council, they should admit India  immediately as a permanent member of the UN Security Council with a veto.  In fact, Martin Wolf once said, and I cite him in my book, “The Great Convergence”, if you have a  
Security council by 2020, with the UK inside and India outside, then it's no longer a credible UN  Security Council. So maybe one gift that the United Kingdom can give to India in return for  having colonised India for so long is to vacate its seat. And as you know, in this year, in 2022,  India's economy in nominal terms, is now bigger than that of the United Kingdom. So if you  want to represent the great powers of today, you should have India in the Security Council and  not the United Kingdom.  And instead, I think what you should have is a single European seat. And that way you will still  have   5   permanent   members   of   the   UN   Security   Council.   I   wrote   my book, The Great  Convergence. I suggested a 7-7-7 formula whereby you have 7 permanent members and 7  semi-permanent members. Because there are some countries, the next 28 largest countries,  always rotate through the Security Council more often, making them semi-permanent. And the  advantage of making them semi-permanent is that then they will welcome the new permanent  members. I mean I will give you some examples.  One reason why Brazil couldn't get this UN Security Council is because Argentina, its neighbour  says, why not me? One reason why India cannot get into the UN Security Council is because its  neighbour Pakistan says, why not me? So why not create a formula whereby countries like  Pakistan and Argentina become semi-permanent members of the UN Security Council? And  they say, okay, I also get something.  So the 7-7-7 formula is the best realistic formula for reforming the UN Security Council. And I  hope that India will look at it seriously because this will facilitate India's early admission into the  UN Security Council. The danger, of course, is that since the West represents a minority of the  world's population, they could, in a sense, effectively self-isolate themselves from the rest of  the world if they start imposing conditions on the rest of the world.  And as we move into the post-Western world, fewer and fewer societies will accept any kind of  pressure or advice from the West on how they should structure their societies. In my book, “Has  China Won?”, I document in Chapter 7 how the United States itself, as a society, is experiencing  some very serious internal social problems. And for the friends of the United States, and I  consider myself a friend of the United States, we would like the United States to do better,  perform better and do well. But for the United States to perform better, it should focus on its  own internal social problem.  The United States is the only major developed country where the average income of the bottom  50% has been going down. And in the year 2022, something remarkable has happened, because  
the United States has a per capita income which is more than six times more than that of China.  And yet, in the year 2022, life expectancy in China became longer than life expectancy in the  United States. And that's amazing. And so the United States should therefore do some deep  reflection on what has gone wrong internally in its society. And the United States should  actually ask itself, can the United States learn lessons from the rest of the world?  Now, this is something, again, that most Americans find inconceivable, that they could learn  lessons from the rest of the world on how to create a more egalitarian, more prosperous  society, especially for the bottom 50%. And so instead of engaging in geopolitical contests with  China, the goal of my book, “Has China Won?”, is to persuade the United States that given its  own internal challenges, and given the fact that China has two internal challenges, the United  States and China should engage in win-win cooperation rather than lose-lose geopolitical  contestation.  Well I think, number one, we have to acknowledge this is a vital principle of international law,  that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is illegal, it violates the UN charter and it's against  international law and therefore it should be condemned. That is very, very clear. But at the same  time, when wars happen, we also have to find out what are the structural causes of the war.  And I think when future historians write about this, like take, for example, how did World War 2  come? How did Hitler emerge? And today the historians agree that the structural reason why  the Nazi regime emerged in Germany is because the Europeans imposed punitive sanctions on  Germany after World War 1, and because they tried to punish Germany, it led to a bad clash and  that’s the creation of a fiercely nationalist leader like Hitler in Germany. This is what British  historians write about.  So, similarly, I think at the end of the Cold War, when Western Europe had a chance to integrate  Russia into a European order and create an order in which Russia was an equal member, there's  no doubt that the opportunity was missed. And here I must say that one lesson that we in East  Asia can learn from all this is that when new powers emerge, like China, it's important to create  an inclusive order that includes the new rising powers. And that's what we have so far  successfully done in East Asia in all our regional arrangements. We include China in the regional  arrangements.  By contrast, the Europeans failed to create a new order which included Russia. Russia was not  included in the European Union, Russia was not included in NATO. And so as a result of it, the  alienation of Russia, that I think was one of the structural causes for this war in Ukraine. And I  think the Europeans should therefore, again, do some deep reflection on what they could have  done to prevent this war in Ukraine from happening.  
Well, I think the United States will remain either the number one or the number two power for  the next 20 - 30 years. It will be a mistake to underestimate the United States and the force and  power of the United States. And at the same time, it's also possible that the United States will  take advantage of some of the suspicions of China's neighbours and try to create an anti-China  coalition. I don't think many countries want to join such a coalition. In fact, most countries in  the world want to have good ties with the United States and want to have good ties with China.  But the United States will remain a force for a long time to come. However, the Europeans don't  have the same kind of force as the United States does. And the United States is very, very far  away from the Islamic world, very far away from Africa, so it doesn't have to worry about  problems in that part of the world. The United States is protected by two powerful oceans,  mighty oceans; the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. But Europe doesn't have that  privilege, and therefore it's important for the Europeans to exercise a far greater degree of  geopolitical realism.  And again, speaking as a friend of Europe, I've been advising Europe to become more realistic in  their geopolitical policies and understand and accept that as we move into a post-Western  world, they have to adjust and adapt to it.  I have always been advocating that in geopolitics you have to be Machiavellian, because  geopolitics is very cold and ruthless and it punishes countries that are geopolitically naive. It is a  fact that many European countries have become geopolitically naive because they haven't  understood where their own long-term interests lie and they're sacrificing their own interests  and concerns for the sake of others.  Rohan Hazell:  Although the post-Western world will see rising powers like China and India having greater  influence on the global stage, this does not mean that the West will become redundant.  Rather, Professor Kishore argues that the multilateral rules-based order set up by the West,  including the UN, should be preserved, and strengthened for the benefit of all.  This will require the West to become more accepting of sharing power with non-Western  countries and respecting their wants.  This is the geopolitical reality facing the West, and neglecting it could lead to unwelcome  tension and even conflict.

Natural Justice in the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the potential for fostering equity and inclusivity in the post-Western world, anchored in the principles of natural justice.The transition to a post-Western world order can be improved by implementing systems of natural justice, which can better foster inclusivity in geopolitics and the global economy.Equity, as opposed to just equality, is crucial for ensuring fair outcomes by addressing underlying systemic issues and providing equal opportunities. Institutionalising equity through strong rule of law and just systems is essential for its effectiveness in creating a more equitable global system.Plurality and collaboration should replace outdated notions of dominance, leading to a new freedom and practical redesign of societies based on equitable principles.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Natural Justice in the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  The transition to the post-Western world is clearly resulting in tensions between nations,  particularly the most powerful ones.  But a new world order also offers opportunities to improve and fix some of the flaws in the  current one.  What inequalities can be addressed?  How can geopolitics be made more inclusive?  And which parts of the global economy should be made less exploitative?  GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair, walks us through potential answers to these questions.  Chandran Nair:  Equity is sort of what you could see as a system of natural justice, fair conduct. It is a system of  fairness and a system of trying to minimise biases and prejudices to affect the outcomes or the  opportunities for individuals. So if you want to look at the difference between equity and  equality, then a simple way of saying this is equality is a process or a way of managing  something whereby you make sure that people in a particular environment who are doing the  same sorts of jobs, have the same conditions, are treated fairly and have the same access to  fulfilling their potential and being rewarded equally.  So an example would be, you have people working in an office, say, Nigeria. You would make  sure that the person working as an accountant in Nigeria is paid a fair wage according to local  conditions, and there's no discrimination within that particular office, between a man and a  woman. So a female accountant is paid the same as a male accountant based on their grade.  There is no discrimination between a Muslim Nigerian or a Christian Nigerian. I'm just giving  Nigeria as an example.  
So equity in a country would be where you understand that individuals and groups of people  have different circumstances and have different socioeconomic backgrounds from which they  arrive. Equity in those situations would be to make sure that for all those different groups, it is  not about giving them the same thing, because they come from different backgrounds, different  access to resources, education, but giving them what is needed appropriately fit for purpose.  But each one is given different things.  So   there   is   a   bit   of   active   discrimination   too, sometimes. It's called affirmative action.  Affirmative action is a process of trying to create equity. Where you say this group of people  have been disenfranchised for so long, we're going to provide them with certain resources so  that over a period of time, and in some countries it might say it's 40 years, 50 years, they can  compete equally because they're so disadvantaged.  That's a system of creating equity. Equity is needed because it's a system of natural justice.  That's why you have it. Then it is important to understand that just because you have a system  of natural justice doesn't mean things will be better, because you need many other things to  essentially allow systems of natural justice, the principles, to then flourish, you need to  institutionalise it. You will have to have strong rule of law, you will have to have a state that is  fair and systems of justice that allow you to leverage a more equitable global system as well.  So it's really important, as we talk about the new world order, or as some people call it,  de-Westernisation, which is not my favourite term, because it implies that we need to erase  Western ideas. It's a zero sum game. We win, you lose. It's more reordering the world in a way  that's more equitable. I think whether you come from China, the United States, Europe, Africa,  we all understand that the 21st century is one that we will make a steep departure from the  past.  What does that redesign look like, particularly in the Western world? I'm at pains to point out to  Western audiences that this new world order is inevitable. It's just demographics. It's the way  the world is. The non-Western world population is about 85% by definition. There will be a shift  because we have passed the era of domination through colonisation. So in the new world, what  we call the post-Western world, as I said cannot be a zero sum game. And adapting to that new  world   requires   a   new   way   of   thinking,   and   adapting   and   changing is really important,  particularly and good for Europe and the United States. It takes away the stress of those  tensions and manages that. It frees people in those countries from worrying and being insecure  about a new world.  It also, in my view, will create a new way that those economies are organised, the way they  interact with the rest of the world. And I think that we are partners in creating a more equitable  world, that is very important. So I think this is really important because not enough people say  it. Some might say, well, what on earth is he saying? If you're European, you might feel  threatened. If you're American, you might say, we're not number one anymore. But actually,  that's a very archaic way of thinking about the world. Most of you are people who are going to  
essentially shape the world over the next 30 - 40 years. Thinking about the shaping of the world  around dominance and essentially monopolies or having disproportionate power is not the way  I think a modern person thinks.  So in the Western world, where there's great schools of thought, so much to offer the world,  that ability to recognise that we are entering a new phase in which plurality, modernity, means  sharing, there is no control, one controlling the other. Just as much as some may argue they  don't want the United States to be the hegemony. What many don't want to see China replace  the United States either or India or Africa. So it frees everybody up away from an old, I believe,  centuries old way of thinking about the world and the human condition does not need to be  trapped in a very archaic way of thinking about dominance. And that's really what this is.  And once you move away from the dominance you find a new freedom and that freedom is in  plurality. We all live in one world and it's not a slogan to feel good. It's a practical way of  redesigning our societies.  Rohan Hazell:  The term equality refers to equally distributed resources, but those equal distribution alone  may not account for circumstance or overcome systemic discrimination.  Equity, on the other hand, addresses systemic issues to offer equal access to opportunities.  A critical success factor in the post-Western world order will be the pursuit of greater equity  across nations and regions, helping to ease tensions and foster greater collaboration.

Investing in the Right Assets for a Sustainable Future

### keyTakeaway
We learned how expanding the conventional metric of measuring economic progress - gross domestic product (GDP) - to include indicators like human and planetary wellbeing, can redirect investment into previously neglected areas, like social and natural capital.Economic activity tends to overlook the social harms and environmental damage it causes, simply because these factors are not accounted for when measuring progress. Thus, GDP must be supplemented with additional indicators like income distribution and wellbeing to accurately gauge a society’s progress.The commons, or shared resources such as the atmosphere and oceans, transcend the jurisdiction of any single nation and are of equal importance to all of humanity. By regarding the commons as shared assets, we can begin to establish the institutions and policies necessary for responsible stewardship.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Investing in the Right Assets for a Sustainable Future  Elaine Fernandez:  Using GDP as the sole measure of economic progress tends to drive investments that prioritise  consumption and financial gain over the wellbeing of people and the environment.  And though this approach has helped to create the modern world, progress in an era plagued by  existential threats requires that we proactively invest in measures that help us mitigate, adapt  and prepare to tackle them head on.  GDP has long been criticised as providing an incomplete picture of the economic, social and  environmental wellbeing of nations.  Many leading global economists, including Nobel prize winners like Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya  Sen have called for new approaches to measure our economic progress.  In 2009, Stiglitz, Sen and the late economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, co-chaired the Commission on  the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress which released a report calling  for alternative indicators to measure wellbeing.  But what exactly does that look like?  To provide more insight, we have Professor Robert Costanza, a leading ecological economist, at  the Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London.  Professor Robert Costanza:  Our primary measure of progress, GDP, gross domestic product, is just measuring the sales and  consumption of goods and services in the economy, not really measuring wellbeing. It was  never designed to measure the wellbeing of the economy.  And even the architects of GDP acknowledged that from the very beginning and warned against  using it for that purpose. And yet that's what's driving a lot of our national policies in almost  every country. And we know that a lot of what's measured in GDP should better be thought of  as a cost rather than a benefit. And there are several alternative indicators that have been  developed. One that I've used is something called the genuine progress indicator, which adjusts  
for the distribution of income. It adds some things that are important, like volunteer work and  household labour.  Major things in many economies that are not given credit because they're not marketed. And  then it subtracts a bunch of things that should definitely be thought of as costs, the cost of air  and water pollution, CO2 emissions and the cost of crime. And when you do that, you find that  in many countries, genuine progress has not been improving for decades now. Those negative  side effects of the GDP growth have cancelled out, so they're positive impact. And so we need  to get those kinds of alternative measures much more into the policy discussion. So you can  make the point that what we really want to do is improve well being and people's lives, and how  we make investments into what kind of assets.  That's one main thing.  But we can also invest in natural capital, we can create protected areas, we can replant forests,  we   can   restore   wetlands.   And   we   can   begin   to   measure   the   public   benefits   of   those  investments, and that's happening quite a bit. I know even in China these days, they're investing  in reforesting some of the low plateau and that's reducing dust storms and air pollution in  Beijing. So they're beginning to understand these connections and I think being able to measure  those impacts is a key element of that, to drive investment into the right places.  Indeed, I think it will change our investment decisions radically, because if you begin to pick up  the benefits that are not marketed, sort of non-marketed public benefits of these investments  much more directly and even the private benefits, I mean, you could think of, for example, what  if we invested more in bike paths and making bicycling and walking much more convenient in  cities, people are not going to buy cars, they're not going to have to buy car insurance.  Their spending may very well go down. And their benefit in terms of mobility and health, all of  those   things   can   actually   improve   quite   significantly.   Have   we   seen   in some cities like  Amsterdam, where that has happened quite a lot.  So I think it's time for that evolution to occur as well in, in how we govern ourselves, how we  make private decisions, especially at the larger scale,  even beyond the nation to the global scale.  And I think there's got to be some openness to experimentation with those kinds of new  institutions. As far as managing our common asset resources like the atmosphere and the  oceans and ecosystems and their services, I think we need to think more along the lines of what  Elinor Ostrom has talked about with how to manage commons. And we propose that these be  thought out as common asset trusts. We need to hold these assets in trust for all of the  stakeholders, including the non-human stakeholders, and manage them in a way that maintains  their value and their contribution and their sustainable wellbeing and health. So we propose  making the atmosphere into a common asset trust.  
And once you've established that, you could say, well, then those individuals that damage that  asset that belongs to all of us should be charged for those damages in the way that we charge  damages to any other kind of profit. And those funds could then be reinvested in protecting the  asset and rebuilding it, sequestering carbon, rebuilding wetlands, plant and forests, all the  things that would help to rebuild the asset, but it will completely refocus the goal there instead  of exploiting and extracting resources from our common assets to protecting and stewarding  them so that they can continue to provide all the benefits that they could provide for humans  and the rest of nature.  As long as we're stuck in the current way of making decisions that are too much influenced by  the interest that wants to see the system continue, then it's going to continue regardless of  what people want. In fact, there have been some good studies that show that the policies, for  example, in the United States, the policies that the majority of the population want, are not the  policies that get implemented. They're exactly the opposite of those policies. Why is that?  The political system is not really coordinated or doing the job that it's supposed to be doing  because of the way it's designed and set up and manipulated. So making those fundamental  changes, I think, is going to take movement both from the top and the middle and the bottom.  Elaine Fernandez:  As Professor Costanza has shared, it's imperative that we direct global investments toward  assets that will improve the wellbeing of people and the environment.  At a local level, this means steering funds toward better managing natural capital, which are the  resources and environmental features that benefit people, like forests that provide timber and  filter our air.  In addition, investing in goods and services with public benefits, like improved mobility and  healthcare, will drastically increase the wellbeing of societies as a whole.  Globally, we can start to   consider The Commons, which are shared resources such as the  atmosphere and oceans, as a collective investment fund.  In practical terms, penalties imposed on those who harm The Commons can be redirected  towards sustainable initiatives, such as carbon sequestration drawdown   and incentivising  responsible investment for environmental preservation and development.

Human Centric Development: Empowering  Individuals and Communities 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned the role that fostering individual wellbeing, self-actualisation and communal decision-making can play in driving sustainable development.Cultivating individual wellbeing and self-actualisation enables people to break free from the natural tendency of only thinking in terms of personal advancement, making them more likely and capable of contributing to the betterment of society.Communities constitute fundamental components of society. They serve as vital hubs for collective decision-making that can direct sustainable development toward contributing to the overall social fabric and wellbeing of society.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Human Centric Development: Empowering Individuals and  Communities  Rohan Hazell :  When looking through the lens of sustainable development at the national or global level, it's  easy to forget that society is ultimately made up of individuals like you and I. Ultimately,  development on a macro level is shaped by the collective actions of   individual citizens. So,  imagine the compounding effect of every person only making choices from a perspective of  scarcity or personal gain, because they feel their wellbeing is threatened. According to Dr.  Mamphela Ramphele, former Managing Director of th e World Bank, this has the potential to  derail sustainable development efforts. It's why she emphasises the importance of nurturing  our wellbeing, especially as it can empower us to contribute to the betterment of society.  Dr. Mamphela Ramphele:  The fact that we are looking at income, hunger, health separately means that we are failing  to recognise that wellbeing is a state of integrated feeling, of being at peace. To be a  developed society, people, the individual citizens within that society, sho uld feel good about  themselves. So, development starts with the inner person in each one of us and all the major  religions. Whether you are looking at Buddhism, you're looking at Hinduism, you're looking  at Christianity, Muslim, they all emphasise this inn er person.  When the inner person is properly nurtured, affirmed, respected, that person becomes a  positive contributor to the health and wellbeing of families, of communities. And we become  mutually supportive in an interdependent, interconnected way. Whereas the cur rent  development model is about winner takes all, it's about the people with the most money. The  billionaires that have pay very little tax are the ones who are listened to by our governments  at the national level, our governments at the international leve l.  And so a new development model is called for. And that development model starts with each  one of us travelling inside. Because when you are at peace inside, you are not going to be  competitive, you're going to be collaborative. When you are at peace inside , you will trust,  because you will be trustworthy. When you are at peace within yourself, you have empathy  and compassion for others, and you will not be involved in corruption and or violence. And  when you are peace within yourself, you appreciate the bea uty of diversity, and so you will  not be undermining other people's dignity because they look different from you.
  So, we have a major opportunity, and I believe that this century, particularly post - COVID, is  pushing us more and more towards adopting this new development model, which starts with  the human being and all living beings at the centre. And those living bein gs are plants as well  as animals because without them, we are nothing.  Rohan Hazell:  New approaches to sustainable development require us to stop viewing prosperity as purely  the acquisition of material symbols like skyscrapers, shopping malls and digital connectivity.  And acknowledging that while important, these advancements do not neces sarily improve  the standard of living across the board. Modernity, for all its incredible benefits, has also  resulted in undesirable and unintended outcomes, often at the expense of what Dr. Ramphele  calls the wellbeing of our inner selves. She points to a   direct connection between personal  fulfilment and our ability to be more empathetic and willing to contribute to improving society  overall.  Dr. Ramphele has established that individually, we are all capable of contributing to the  sustainable development of our societies. However, by leveraging the areas or groups that  you are a part of, like families and local councils, individual contribution s are elevated to  collective action. Here we'll speak to Dr. Mamphela Ramphele about how individuals can work  with their respective communities to steer development in a more sustainable direction.  Dr. Mamphela Ramphele:  We can't do it as individuals. We have to do it as circles of support. I should start with my  family to have conversations in my family about what kind of South Africa we would like to  see, and how each one of us could contribute towards, and what other th ings that we as a  family should do to make sure that every individual member of the family is enabled, is  supported to become the best version of themselves. And this is an ongoing, nurturing  process.  The same thing applies to communities. That communities, when we grew up, communities  used to have these monthly meetings where they take stock of what's going on in the  community, where offence going wrong. Are there wild animals threaten the livestock? O r  are there people for example, who are not behaving properly in terms of cutting down trees?  Because when we grew up, you are not allowed to cut a tree unless you have been given  permission to do so, because the tree is either sick or something, or it's i n the way or  something that the community agrees to do. So, we need to return to that wisdom.  But I also believe that young people today should use their cell phones, this connectivity, not  to find out what's the latest fashion, but to learn how do other people do things. There is a  lot of wisdom we can learn from indigenous communities across the   globe, the Maasai, the  people in the Aborigines in Australia, and here at home in South Africa. There are many
  indigenous communities with the wisdom that we need to leverage. And young people should  know that, because you can't be a self - confident player out there in the world when you are  not properly anchored about who you are and you respect and are proud of yo ur culture,  your language, your dignity, et cetera. But at the same time, to know that your culture is one  amongst many which is what makes humanity such a diverse and rich set of possibilities.  I am a firm believer that the future belongs to young people. You have all the opportunities  in terms of access to education, access to technology, access to understanding the world in  its breadth and depth that we didn't have. And so those benefits impose   a responsibility on  each and every one of you as young people to lead. Lead yourself to be disciplined. Lead in  whatever you do, do it well. Because it matters not just for you, but it matters for the world.  And I know you'll be able to do it. Thank you.  Rohan Hazell:  After family, the next fundamental building block of society is the community. But this is often  neglected   in   approaches   to   sustainable   development,   and   this   is   reflected   in   the  unsustainable systems and institutions we design. For example, it's all too ea sy to create  development solutions that benefit the minority at the expense of the majority and the  environment. Like when wide - scale deforestation in the interest of commodities trading  causes environmental degradation and loss of livelihoods for local po pulations.  As Dr. Ramphele has shared, making community the cornerstone from which decisions are  made allows us to collectively reimagine a more sustainable future for our societies.

Redesigning Governance Systems

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we explored the vital need to improve our governance systems. They should aim to create a stable, equitable, and harmonious society, which is vital for supporting economic activity without creating disruptions.Successful governance involves the inclusion of multiple stakeholders, including the government, private sector, NGOs, and communities. Engaging various perspectives allows for the co-creation of solutions and helps build consensus.Transparency, Accountability, and Inclusivity: These guiding principles are essential for governance systems at various levels, from global to local. Transparency is fundamental for establishing trust and credibility, while accountability ensures that governance decisions have real consequences. Inclusivity facilitates a more cross-sectorial approach to policy implementation.Decision-makers need to understand the issues at hand thoroughly and avoid making decisions based on personal biases or preconceptions. Effective governance requires a commitment to learning, doing research, and listening to various viewpoints before making informed decisions.Societal systems are influenced by cultural norms, relationships, values, and behaviours, which collectively shape how society operates. Understanding these complexities is crucial for effective governance.The decisions taken within governance systems have a significant impact on individuals, families, colleagues, and society as a whole, making the integrity and effectiveness of governance critical for creating a sustainable and harmonious society.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Governance Systems  Elaine Fernandez:  In the last chapter, we explored the ways in which we can approach a redesign of our economic  systems. In this chapter, we'll examine how our governance systems need to be transformed.  After all, without effective governance of communities, organisations and countries, it will be  extremely challenging to create and sustain healthy economic and societal conditions for people  and the planet.  To start, you'll hear from GIFT.ed chairman, Chandran Nair, who makes the case for good  governance to create stable, equitable, and sustainable societies.  Chandran Nair:  You govern so that you create a stable society. And we can talk about what we mean by a stable  society, but fundamentally it's a society in which there is equity. People have access to the basic  rights of life, which I will talk about. And so you govern so that a societal harmony is created.  There is social equity and social balance so that everybody has equal access.  That doesn't mean some socialist utopia. And to do that, you need to have economic activity,  but economic activity that does not create disparities, which allow for disharmony or economic  activities that essentially disrupt governance systems so that economic actors do not capture  the institutions of the state.  And that's the role of the government. You see, throughout the world, when governance  systems fail, and the government itself has forgotten its obligations to govern fairly to create a  good social environment, a society in which its obligations to the, the social conditions are  paramount, then you can't have a good economy either because there's so much distortions, et  cetera. So we need to understand that even to have a good economy, then you have, the  government has to create the conditions, the preconditions for that.  Ultimately, all societies do need systems of governance. The same systems of governance that  are used in some countries cannot be deployed to others. The Pakistan need is going to be very  
different from the needs in Indonesia. The needs in Nigeria are going to be very different from  the needs in Egypt.  So each country will have to have its own way of dealing with this. And the danger at the  moment is so many in the multilateral systems, et cetera, think there's one way of doing these  things, and that needs to be challenged and debunked. The institutions of our society, call it the  state of the government, need to play an active role in managing resources and directing the  course of economic activity. It needs to serve the primary goal of providing the population with  the basic rights of life. Those being, and I think we can all agree, food– safe and secure, water  and sanitation, the security of a home, basic electricity, and so on. This is what differentiates  what I call the sustainable state from just a developmental state.  Elaine Fernandez:  Redesigning national governance systems to transition from developmental to sustainable  states first requires an understanding and appreciation of the reality that whilst governments  have a responsibility to facilitate thriving economies, they cannot decouple that objective from  the responsibility to ensure societies are also equitable, just and fair.  However, in order for governance systems to be effective and get buy-in from the [00:04:00]  people and organisations they govern, there are guiding principles that should be adhered to.  Three of the most important are transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. These principles  apply to governance at the global, regional, national, and local level.  To explore these factors more, you'll hear from Sharon Burrow, the first woman to serve as  General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation.  Sharon Burrow:  You need a legislative foundation that puts people and the planet at the heart of demands that  business and governments must accede to, you need transparency. If there is no transparency,  then accountability is just an empty word. And if you're going to have accountability, you have  to have a compliance model that is serious, is inclusive of everybody and allows for a, for not a  punitive approach in total, although there will be some elements of sanctions where people  simply don't want to follow the rules, but actually allows for a development approach.  
So we have to set up the mechanisms, whether it's national, at corporation, or local level, that  allow people to have their grievances heard, based on evidence, ensure remedy, and in return,  think about how we learn from that to build prevention into the model.  It can be done. It is being done by good corporations, and you've got new standards emerging.  You know, the ISSB standard has already achieved a level of compatibility between that new  standard for climate and the, and the European standard. So we can reshape the economic base  of our future, but we have to have everybody at the table and people have to be able to see it  and it comes back to our levels of governance at all levels.  Elaine Fernandez:  Organisations around the world are recognising the need to redesign their governance systems  to   be   more   transparent,   accountable   and   inclusive.   These   factors   lead   to   effective  decision-making and ultimately, with the right intentions, drive positive outcomes. As Ms.  Burrow explained, a key element in any effective governance system is gaining trust, especially if  we want to disrupt the status quo and create the conditions for a healthy economy, society, and  planet. Yet trust in governments and businesses is increasingly frayed and fragile. How can we  remedy this?  One way is by taking a multistakeholder approach. We'll explore this with Abdulla bin Touq, the  Minister for Economy of the United Arab Emirates as he speaks about the steps he has taken to  gather national consensus on the creation of a circular economy.  His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq:  First of all, the circuit current policy was adopted by following a very comprehensive study.  That's the first thing we did to conduct on the national level, in which we took in consideration  the institutional ecosystem for the circular economy, the overall vision, the goals, the multiple  stakeholders involved in complete alignment with the SDGs.  So we had to align on the top level to see where we stand. Where are we at the moment? How  different is the national level from the local levels?  Before proceeding with the policy implementation, the council was formed in order to supervise  and support the implementation of the Circular Economic Policy Committee.  
And the committee has representative or secretary from federal government, local government,  private sector and NGOs. So we managed to cover the whole spectrum. From the very  beginning, the council has adopted a bottom up approach, like we mentioned, opening the  [00:08:00] doors to the private sector. And until date as well, we are adding more and more  members to the council from the private sector.  And we have partners like Nestle, PepsiCo, Michelin, General Motors from transportation, bN,  Viola, Infrastructure, and Tetra Park from manufacturing. So it's really some of the biggest  names   out   there   that   participate   in   the   council   deliberation   and   decisions. So we see  international multinational companies that are part of our council and they are supporting and  thinking about with us on the challenges that we see.  So   having   a   more   consensual   and   more   cross-sectoral   approach   can   ease   the   policy  implementation and the acceptance of council decisions. And one thing we understood back  then as well is how do we involve the private sector, how do you involve the right stakeholders,  the communities, bringing everybody in because everyone has a different viewpoint that allows  you to design visions and strategies the way that it should be.  Elaine Fernandez:  This case study from the UAE is a success story of effective governance, based firmly in the multi  stakeholder approach. It also informs us of key steps needed in the decision-making process,  including setting a clear vision, securing real representation, listening to the needs of others,  co-creating solutions, and driving shared ownership.  Too often, decisions are taken without including those who are actually impacted or by leaders  who may not be fully informed. This brings us to the last element of governance that needs a  redesign. The decision-making frameworks used by individuals, particularly those in positions of  authority. You'll hear from Christine Loh, former policymaker, think tank founder, and current  chief development strategist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  Prof. Christine Loh:  When I was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong legislature in 1992, there really weren't  political parties in Hong Kong. There wasn't even a line that I could follow. And obviously all of  us are limited by our own direct area of knowledge and what I found sitting in the legislature  was that I had to vote on many things ranging from environment to education to social welfare  to legal matters and so on.  
And I must admit that I felt extremely uncomfortable because most areas I was ignorant of  them. But I had a vote. I had to support things. I had to support very specific things. And I had to  speak at motions raised by other legislators. So obviously I had to learn very quickly. And I  developed a method where I thought, well, you know, I'm either not going to say anything if I  don't understand it and listen to others.  Or if I really have to vote, I have to do some really basic 101 homework. And I had to understand  enough myself to be able to make a decision. So, I read up on things. I went and talked to  people who I thought could provide different aspects of that problem and then tried to think  about it before I would cast my vote.  What surprised me was I had a better understanding of my own biases and prejudices. It's  almost like that, you know, we sit together at a dinner and, you know, we just shoot off and talk  about what we like and what we don't like. But when you have the responsibility to actually  support something, you know, or to refute something that has an impact on millions of people,  I've really felt extremely uncomfortable.  And as I said, Hong Kong in 1992 did not have political parties where I could vote with the party.  It was my responsibility to understand enough to be able to cast a vote that I felt was  responsible.  Elaine Fernandez:  Governance systems are the foundation upon which redesigning society will take place. After  all, in your country, organisation, and community, decisions are taken that impact you, your  family, colleagues, and fellow citizens every day. But it's also important to recognise that  societies around the world are not just the product of governance systems.  Every society is comprised of cultural norms, relationships, values, and behaviours that, taken  together, form our societal systems, which we'll explore in the last chapter of this module.

The Major Sustainability Milestones

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we explored the origins of sustainability as a concept, from its philosophical underpinnings to the rise of international organisations dedicated to improving our social, economic, and environmental conditions. Modern sustainability has its roots in philosophical thinking that explores the relationship between people and nature. This thinking has evolved over time and in different parts of the world, and shapes sustainability discussions today.The 20th century saw sustainability enter global discussions, with the creation of sustainability-oriented laws, literature, and entire multilateral institutions - all of which are predicated on a deeper understanding of humanity’s impact on the natural world.The 21st century has seen the push for sustainable development accelerate. From reporting initiatives to the Sustainable Development Goals and a multitude of “green” products and services, the public, private, and civil society sectors are attempting to address the sustainability challenge.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Major Sustainability Milestones  Rohan Hazell :  Sustainability is much more than a buzzword. From shaping government agendas to  influencing business models and guiding international civil society initiatives, sustainability is  fast becoming a driving force in our world, one that impacts you, your commun ity, country,  and organisation.  But the reality is, sustainability means different things to different people. That’s why it is  incumbent on all of us to have a good understanding of it and how it’s shaping our future.  In this series, you will go on a journey of deconstructing and reimagining sustainability from  a fresh perspective.  You’ll hear from leading global experts on what our greatest sustainability challenges are.  We’ll also examine some of the greatest myths about   sustainability and   help you to come to  your own conclusions about the challenges we face and how to overcome them.  To start, we’ll lay the foundation by looking at a timeline of the origins of sustainability and  how it has been influenced by different cultures, philosophies and organisations.  The underpinnings of modern sustainability can be traced as far back as the 17th century,  with the philosophies of key thinkers like Thomas Malthus, Jean - Jacques Rousseau, and John  Stuart Mill, who discussed the importance of balance between human developm ent and  nature.  Malthus is best known for his work, "An Essay on the Principle of Population," first published  in 1798, which proposed the idea that population growth would eventually outstrip available  resources, leading to widespread famine, poverty, and suffering.  This outcome, termed a Malthusian Trap, still influences sustainability discussions today.  In America in the 19th century, concerns for protecting natural resources were arising, with  thinkers like John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions.  Muir in particular successfully lobbied the American government in 1890 to   form Yosemite  National Park in California, the first large - scale conservation effort of its kind.
  These conservationist principles, as well as the belief in the rights of nature, became the  bedrock of modern environmentalism.  In the 20th century, disparate movements came together to form sustainability as we know  it today. In 1948, the International Union for the Protection of Nature was founded. It aimed  to promote a unique partnership of government and nongovernmental organis ations to  protect the environment.  It exists to this day, but you may know it as the International Union for Conservation of  Nature, or IUCN, the organisation that produces the endangered animals list. It now has a  membership of over 1,400 organisations. and a network of 15,000 scientists a nd experts that  work in IUCN commissions.  In 1952, the Great Smog of London caused by industrial air pollution led to the deaths of 12  thousand people, prompting the Clean Air Act of 1956, a milestone in what would become  modern environmental regulation.  And in the   mid - 20th   century, numerous writers tackled the relationship between humans and  the environment. One of the most significant was Rachel Carson, an American marine  biologist, who wrote "Silent Spring" in 1962, which highlighted how pesticides can spread up  the food   chain and decimate bird populations. Her book became a global success, sparking  the modern environmental movement as we know it today.  Ten years later, the international community began organising regular conferences that deal  with sustainability. In 1972, the United Nations ran the Stockholm Conference on the Human  Environment. Many believe this marked the first global attempt to address   environmental  sustainability. Importantly, it led to the formation of the United Nations Environment  Programme, or UNEP. This set the tone for international efforts to steward environmental  resources, which ran in parallel to governments setting national   environmental regulations  for the very first time. For example, America’s Environmental Protection Agency, set up in  1970, was the first national agency dedicated to the environment.  Different research efforts also played an important role during this time. For example, also in  1972, the global scientific think tank the Club of Rome published the seminal report, "The  Limits to Growth," which was the first major attempt at modelling the   consequences of  uncontrolled resource consumption, and ultimately called for a state of global equilibrium in  our economic models. It was controversial at the   time but   is now seen as being ahead of its  time.  Then in 1979, the World Climate Conference concluded that the "greenhouse effect" from  increased buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere demanded urgent international  action.
  Ultimately, these different strands of research and international institutional efforts came  together in 1980, when the IUCN published the “World Conservation Strategy,” which  identified the main agents of habitat destruction as poverty, population pressur e, social  inequity, and trading regimes. The strategy called for a new development strategy to address  inequities as a core driver of sustainability. It was also the first time the term “sustainable  development” was brought to the global stage.  At this point, sustainable development began to appear in international discussions, which  brings us to the World Commission on Environment and Development of 1987, also known as  the Brundtland Commission. It expanded on the concept of sustainable developm ent in the  report "Our Common Future", defining it as “development that meets the needs of the  present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”  This is a pivotal moment because it confirmed what we know today: sustainability is not just  as an environmental movement, but an effort to transform how our economic systems,  governance mechanisms, and societies operate.  After the term sustainable development was coined, national and international initiatives  began to accelerate. In 1992, the Earth Summit and the famous Kyoto Protocol took place,  formally bringing the climate change challenge into government agendas across   the world.  In 1996, the International Organization for Standardization introduced ISO 14001, which  required businesses to ensure their activities have minimal environmental impact. This is  followed by the Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index which tracks leading corp orate  sustainability practices worldwide, to facilitate global flows of capital into sustainable  businesses. This is an important step in formalising the rise of socially responsible investing,  which remains as one of the most   widely discussed   elements of sustainability to this day.  And in 2002, the Global Reporting Initiative formulated guidelines on how organisations  should report on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of their business  activities   -   the first of its kind.  After this, efforts to move businesses toward being more socially and environmentally  responsible became more intense, and the UN published a report in 2004 entitled “Who Cares  Wins,” which is widely considered to be the first mainstream mention of Environ mental,  Social, and Governance concerns, or ESG.  As a result of this rising trend, companies around the world began releasing products and  services that are supposedly “green”, or less destructive to the environment and societies.  This ranges from cars to fertiliser and consulting services.  Then in 2015, the world saw the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals, or SDGs, in which 193 countries reinforced the global commitment to sustainability.
  These goals cover a broad range of sustainability issues, from ending global poverty to  guaranteeing food security and providing universal education. Also, nearly every country  signed the Paris Agreement, a   legally binding   successor to the Kyoto protocol, to try and limit  global warming to 1.5°C.  Since the 2015 turning point, global efforts are now being made to enact sustainable  development at a scale never before seen. These initiatives have had varying levels of success,  but whatever your opinion of it, sustainability is here to stay.  In the next chapter we will revisit the sustainability timeline with a critical eye to see some of  the important factors commonly missed, starting with   non - Western contributions to  sustainable development.

Transforming Business Beyond "Business-As-Usual"

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that the longevity of a business is ultimately dependent on a company's ability to adapt and carefully consider the role it wants to play in redesigning society. Sustainability is much more than complying with environmental regulations, ESG reporting, or performing CSR. For real change to happen, sustainability must be an integral part of all business activities.Going beyond “business-as-usual” requires companies to reimagine their business models and reprioritise their objectives in light of the societal challenges we face and in line with ever-shifting stakeholder expectations.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Transforming Business Beyond “Business-As-Usual”  Elaine Fernandez:  Breaking the business-as-usual paradigm means integrating sustainability throughout the entire  organisation and viewing it as more than just a box-ticking exercise. To offer some advice for  driving these transformations at the organisational level, we hear from Richard Lancaster,  Executive Director and former Chief Executive Officer of CLP holdings.  Richard Lancaster:  Recognising the change in any organisation is hard. It does take persistence in order to see it  through. If I was to look at what really helps, it is around communication. It's not hiding from  issues, it's discussing them openly within the organisation. Not being frightened to bring up  conversations around issues of sustainability and around things that you believe are important  to your organisation. It's often a case that businesses deal with urgent things that are on them  right here and now.  If you just look over the past few years, the amount of executive time that was spent on  managing the COVID crisis and that was important, that was really important. But you can't  forget about the longer term issues because there's always a crisis, there's always something  there. And sustainability issues are things which never go away. They're societal trends that are  perhaps faster or slower, but they are always changing and always evolving. So I think it's  recognising that these issues are always going to be important. Don't be frightened to bring  these issues up. Have a conversation about them, make sure that we understand them. Start  thinking through the implications to your business and then start setting targets, setting plans  and communicating those.  I think as a leader, you know, we're all learning that the world is changing, the world is adapting,  which means that you're constantly learning new things and I think you always have to. It's not  a matter of being humble, it's just a matter of recognising that you don't know everything.  There's a lot of things that come up that are new that you haven't thought about. I always find  that the most interesting questions I'm asked are the ones that I haven't thought about.  Somebody's brought something up that hasn't appeared on my radar screen and I stop and  
think about that and that is really where I get value from talking to people and it's those  questions that you haven't thought about that are the really valuable ones.  So creating an environment where people feel free to ask questions. And I think our younger  generation, I find, are perhaps more courageous than we were. They do bring these questions  up and I think it's great and I think that's a very positive sign.  We operate in an industry, which is an essential service to the community. We power, we cool  and heat homes in societies for millions of customers. So it is a politically important industry.  Climate change has been debated in many political forums around the globe. And the pace at  which different countries adopt climate policies has varied enormously. We've seen some  countries adopt very aggressive targets and move very quickly. We've seen others that have  been slow to respond. I think a watershed moment was in 2015 in Paris with the climate  agreement that was struck there that generally created alignment globally. So that brought  political policies pretty much into line. We haven't yet seen the coal plants close down fast  enough, but there's a lot of work preparing for that, which I'm always very encouraged with.  Unfortunately, we are coming up against a deadline. There is a carbon budget, and there is an  amount of carbon dioxide that we can put into the atmosphere that will limit global warming at  whatever temperature we choose. But if we want to stay well below two degrees, there's a very  limited amount of carbon dioxide that we can put in over the next 30 years. So I liken that to an  analogy of driving a bus towards the edge of the cliff. And so far, we've taken our foot off the  accelerator, but we haven't put our foot on the brakes. And I fear that we are not treating this  with the urgency that we need to. So that would be my assessment there. A lot of good work is  being done, but we've really got to tackle the next decade in particular with a sense of urgency.  I think business needs to think beyond business as usual for a couple of reasons. The converse  of sustainability is just being unsustainable. And if you don't change, and if you don't adapt, you  just become unsustainable. And what future is there for any business that is unsustainable? So I  think all businesses need to understand that being sustainable is just simply about being aligned  with the societies in which you operate. It's being aligned with the wishes and desires of your  customers and your broader stakeholders. So I think the more that business leaders understand  that, I think it will change our mindset. I think that will help build trust in business. It will start to  get more support. It will start to see business as a partner and as an important sector of society  that can actually help improve our society and is not just there for profits. And I think our  reputation as a business community, the trust that people have, the respect that we have as a  
business sector, I think we've got quite a bit of work that we can do and I think there's only  upside if we can do that.  Elaine Fernandez:  Sustainability is much more than just complying with environmental regulations, ESG reporting  or performing CSR activity. In essence, it is about the longevity of a business and is ultimately  dependent on a company’s ability to adapt and carefully consider the role it wants to play in  redesigning society.  Going beyond business as usual requires companies to reimagine their business models and  reprioritise their objectives in light of societal challenges we face and in line with ever shifting  stakeholder expectations.

Why Addressing Externalities Cannot Wait 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the pressing need to address externalities with immediacy as they threaten to push us past crucial planetary boundaries, jeopardising the stability of Earth's systems that support humanity.The crisis of capitalism is deeply intertwined with the issue of externalities, where neither companies nor individuals are bearing the “true costs” of production and consumption, leading to societal and environmental impacts.Population growth, coupled with the reliance on consumption-driven economics, exacerbates the urgency of addressing the externalities dilemma.Technological advancements, particularly in digital and extractive technologies, facilitate faster exploitation of natural resources and exacerbate resource inequalities, environmental damage and existing societal challenges.“Internalising” externalities through measures like pricing, regulation, or redesigning business models is crucial for mitigating current existential threats. and societal traumas caused by underpricing and overconsumption.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Why Addressing Externalities Cannot Wait  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are one of the major unaccounted-for issues of our global economic system. They  are so ubiquitous that even beginning to address them presents a major challenge to business  models and government policy-making alike.  But if we are to continue producing and consuming at a rate that leads to improved quality of  life, we must make a start - now. We explore how in this chapter.  Rohan Hazell:  If externalities have always been a side effect of human activities, then why are we so  concerned with them now and why are they so central to redesigning society?  The externalities dilemma sits right at the heart of the crisis of capitalism: neither companies  nor individuals are paying the true cost of production and consumption. Our economic model is  reliant on under-pricing to encourage over consumption and, as we’ve seen in this module, the  real costs are being borne by society and nature.  By internalising these externalities through strategies such as pricing, regulation or business  model redesign, we can mitigate current existential threats and societal traumas.  Addressing this crisis is made all the more urgent by population growth. Billions have entered  the consuming classes in recent decades, and most countries rely on consumption to drive  economic growth.  In this paradigm, companies are incentivised to lower prices even further by continuing their  free ride on the environment and by externalising the true costs to society.  Advances in digital and extractive technology are making it easier to both exploit natural  resources and consume goods and services at an ever-increasing rate.  
In a resource-constrained world, exploitation and under-pricing of raw materials exacerbates  resource inequalities within and across nations, and harms the environment, depleting our  stocks of fresh water, arable land, clean water, forests and fisheries.  Perhaps the greatest threat we face, climate change, is spurred on by externalities created in a  carbon-intensive   economy   reliant   on   burning   fossil   fuel   and   by   the   manufacture   of  petrochemicals for a variety of commercial purposes ranging from plastics and fertilisers to  detergents and tyres.  But climate change is only one of many existential threats. We cannot price every externality,  but we have a moral obligation to start to use a range of economic and social measures to  reduce the negative externalities which are producing harm that our societies should not have  to endure.  Remember, climate change is just one of nine planetary boundaries which scientists agree  cannot be passed without putting our societies at risk.   All nine are profoundly impacted by  unchecked externalities of production and consumption. These boundaries are:  1.   Climate change  2.   Biodiversity loss  3.   Ocean acidification  4.   Ozone depletion  5.   Freshwater use  6.   Atmospheric aerosol pollution  7.   Land-system change  8.   Biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus; and  9.   The release of novel chemicals like radioactive materials and plastics  Whilst earth systems are always in a state of flux, our biosphere, oceans and atmosphere are  interconnected, and have maintained relative balance and stability for the past 12,000 years,  during which human life on the planet has flourished.  In   2009   an   international   interdisciplinary   team of scientists convened by the Stockholm  Resilience Centre defined the boundaries of these nine key processes for a “safe operating  space for humanity” on Earth.  
Crossing these boundaries may lead us over a tipping point whereby these processes lose  resilience and transition abruptly and irreversibly into a new climatic state – one which may not  support humanity.  At the time of producing this course, that balance is in jeopardy, as humanity is already existing  outside of the safe operating space for at least four of the nine boundaries: climate change,  biodiversity, land-system change and biogeochemical flows. All four of these processes are  being heavily impacted by the persistent negative externalities of global agribusiness and  industry.  Our ability to stay within the other five boundaries, potentially restore these four processes  back to stable states, and return to a safe operating space will, in large part, be determined by  how we manage externalities, which is why a practical understanding of this economic concept  is crucial for redesigning society.  Elaine Fernandez:  In   summary,   externalities   are   an   issue   with   our   global   economic   model,   and   they are  exacerbated by global population growth, increased consumption, and advances in technology  that facilitate faster exploitation of natural resources.  But addressing them has multiple benefits, especially for tackling some of the largest challenges  of our time, including climate change, biodiversity loss, public health crises, and more.

Business' Role in the Social Contract 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we examined the concept of the social contract, which represents society’s expectations of the private sector, including how businesses treat employees, the uptake of the goods and services they provide, and how they interface with the government.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted weaknesses in the social contract, manifesting in varied global responses and revealing underlying societal tensions and discord.The swift pace of change in sectors like finance, technology, and the gig economy has led to regulatory inadequacies, causing societal anxiety among service users, providers, and owners.Stark living standards disparities, exacerbated by climate change and media-driven social polarisation, are reshaping how businesses are perceived and their role in society, resulting in greater pressure for businesses to create social value.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Business’ Role in The Social Contract  Elaine Fernandez:  The social contract is at the heart of redesigning society. It shapes relationships and influences  interactions within and across the economic, cultural, social and political spheres of life. The  currency of the social contract is expectations. Expectations about what is or is not acceptable  behaviour. Expectations about value creation, about considering the interests of different  parties and fulfilling obligations to stakeholders.  When   it   comes   to   business,   those   stakeholders'   expectations   also   shift   with   changing  socioeconomic and political conditions.  To explain more, we'll hear from Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global Institute for  Tomorrow, who will explore the social contract and what its current form means for business.  Eric Stryson:  Now, let's consider the concept of the social contract. What is the social contract? We can  define it as the tacit agreement of what is or is not acceptable in society. It's essentially what we  expect of each other, or you could consider it what we owe each other in a harmonious,  well-functioning society, but also how individuals and businesses interact and understand and  respond to each other.  Here in Hong Kong, when the pandemic hit, everybody was wearing masks immediately.  Everybody obeyed the social distancing guidelines, and there was a great solidarity within  society, understanding that health came first, before anything else. The social contract relates to  things as simple as how individuals cross the street, waiting for traffic lights or jaywalking at will.  How people use public transport, how much space they give each other, or how cramped they  are together.  It's important to remember, however, that the social contract was already fraying before the  COVID pandemic hit. And this is due to a multiplicity of factors, everything from geopolitics and  increased global competition, to new business and employment models. Consider the rise of  the gig economy, and the rise of food delivery apps and ride sharing, for example. These put  
new stressors on individuals who are working in these jobs, and also the relationship between  those who are using the services, those who are providing the services, and actually those who  own or who have financial control over these services.  So these are very new dynamics in society which are affecting the social contract. The speed of  change within the private sector has led to great anxiety within society, and in a way, a  perception that the rules and regulations which are there to protect us have been inadequate.  This is particularly well documented in the finance sector, in food, in pharmaceuticals, and now  with the technology sector. Technology is changing so fast that many of us feel that we are at  risk, whether that is for hacking and financial crime, that the regulations are not protecting us  well enough, or that the science and the speed of change that goes into the food that we eat or  the medicines that we take is going too fast that regulation cannot keep up. And therefore, who  is protecting our best interest if the regulators can't keep up with the speed of change? So  again, this is causing tension and causing great anxiety within society.  So it's really important to understand some of the forces which are shaping our modern social  contract. We have divergence in the quality of life, even within cities and within regions. We  have those who are living extreme quality of life, with all of the comforts and conveniences,  multiple houses, space, and yet we have others who are living in very cramped conditions, who  don't have access even to the basics, and they're essentially living side by side. So, of course,  this will affect how the social contract is felt in those societies. We have media and social  polarisation, we have narratives which have driven people further and further apart into their  echo chambers, where we only listen to those opinions which reinforce our particular view. And  unless we take the time to go and understand other people's point of view within society, we  will again have a social contract which is strained and fraying.  Elaine Fernandez:  Expectations of businesses are constantly shifting. These expectations are often situated within  the wider social contract, which can determine if a business succeeds or even fails. This is why  it's so important for businesses to be aware of their role in creating value for society, or they can  face significant backlash, as we've seen with tobacco and fossil fuel companies. And when the  social contract may be fraying due to large-scale social, environmental and technological  changes, governmental regulations and consumer behaviours are constantly evolving. This  makes social value creation even more important, not just as a marketing effort, but as a  genuine business strategy to navigate social complexity.

What is Civil Society?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Karim Rushdy unpacked the expansive nature of civil society, its relation to other pillars of society, and the pivotal role it plays in fostering social cohesion, advocating for marginalised communities, and promoting democratic governance.Civil society encompasses a range of diverse organisations beyond NGOs, representing ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious, and philanthropic interests.Collaboration between civil society, business, government, and media is vital for addressing societal needs, filling service gaps, and maintaining checks and balances against misconduct.Civil society organisations play a crucial role in addressing social injustices by advocating for overlooked issues and amplifying marginalised voices, Contrary to popular belief, civil society has significant influence in governance, economics, and market structures, offering benefits such as independent insights and enhancing societal well-being through collaboration.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  What is Civil Society?  Host:  Civil society, and civil society organisations or CSOs, are a pillar of our modern world. But they’re  often not very well understood, and certainly   don’t receive the same level of attention as  government, business, and media   -   the other key pillars of a well - functioning society.  In this core module, you’ll learn about the vital role that CSOs play in acting as a check - and -  balance on the activities of business and government;   filling gaps   in the provision of goods,  services and basic needs to marginalised or vulnerable groups. We’ll also look at some of the  most significant challenges they face from funding and ethical dilemmas to their relationship with  the public, private and media sectors.  We’ll explore these ideas and more with Karim Rushdy, former Managing Director at GIFT and  current Advisor to GIFT.ed, who will make the case that government,   business and CSOs should  proactively seek out opportunities for collaboration in order to increase   wellbeing   and prosperity  across the world.  Karim Rushdy:  Simply put, civil society is not the government and it's not business. But that leaves a whole range  of other organisations and groups in our society. So the World Bank actually defines civil society  as any organisation that expresses the interests of memb ers or other groups that   are based on  ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious or philanthropic considerations. So it's a huge  umbrella that we're looking at here and it leaves a lot.  Of course, charities and NGOs are a big part of that and play a very important role in the civil  society landscape. But you've also got professional associations, industry associations, religious  groups. Amateur sports is a big part of civil society in man y countries. Organisations that are  fighting for the rights of indigenous populations. You've got labour   unions;   you've got think tanks.  Even your college alumni chapter is a civil society organisation. So it's a really, really big umbrella.
  When we do work in business or we work in government, we often think of civil society as those  NGOs or those charities. But the truth is we wear many hats. We may wear during the daytime a  hat, which is our professional hat, working in a company, as a mana ger, as an engineer. But  outside of work, we may also wear a civil society hat. We may be a member of a sports club, we  might be part of a labour union, we might serve on our children's parent - teacher association. So  it's really important to remember that   we are all part of civil society, even those of us that work  in business and work in government.  So civil society does not operate in isolation. And we sometimes talk about civil society as being  one of the key pillars for a   well - functioning   society, alongside business, alongside government,  and alongside the media. So it's really critical that civil society partners with these other three  pillars in everything that it does, so that it doesn't operate in isolation, and so that it can fill gap s  where it needs to. So one of the key responsibilities, I think, of civil society is to partner with  business, partner with government, in order to reach out to communities that business and  government may not be able to reach on their own.  Another responsibility of civil society is to act as a check - and - balance, kind of an honest broker,  and look out for bad behaviour in the public sector and private   sector and   make the rest of us  aware of that. And in a similar vein, civil society also shines a spotlight on issues which are very  important to one group or another, but maybe being overlooked. And it does that by partnering  with the government, by organising at th e grassroots level, getting people out onto the streets  sometime to protest. So any way that it can raise awareness around certain issues is a key  responsibility. It also fills gaps.  So in many countries, there are segments of the population which are underserved. They may  not have access to certain basic needs, like electricity or housing, or they may not have access to  public services like education and healthcare. And in these insta nces, civil society can step in  again, collaborate with government and business, ideally, but help these vulnerable communities  to access the services that they need.  One other area that civil society plays a key role is in providing independent insights and an  independent perspective, researching into to sociopolitical trends, economic trends. For  example, if a government issues a budget for the average person on the s treet, that budget may  be pretty difficult to understand. You often get civil society organisations who would look at that  budget, they'd analyse it and then they'd present it back to the public in simple terms, helping  them to understand and giving them a   fresh perspective on it. An independent perspective that  is not entrenched within the government or within business.
  There is a common misperception that civil society is not influential, doesn't have power, and it's  okay to ignore it on the part of business and government. And I think part of this misperception  comes from a lack of understanding of what the civil societ y landscape actually looks like.  We mentioned some of them earlier, professional associations, academic groups, religious  groups, lobbyists, labour unions. So when you look at this spectrum of organisations and you see  how far reaching it is and how those groups are involved in almost eve ry aspect of our economies,  of the way that our countries are governed, of the way that we do business and the way that our  markets are structured, then it becomes clear that there are not only opportunities to  collaborate, but many   benefits to collaboration with civil society, to having a good understanding  of how civil society operates and how civil society organisations may be involved in issues which  are important to not just you personally but you professionally, your organisati on, your area of  responsibility within the organisation, whether that organisation is a company in the private  sector or a government agency and you are, you know, a civil servant, you should certainly be  looking at collaborating with civil society at ever y single step in the work that you do.  Host:  The CSO Sector is extremely diverse.   It extends   well beyond charities and NGOs, and you are  probably involved in one or more CSOs yourself!  As Karim has shared, civil society organisations act as an important pillar alongside business,  government and the   media to   lay a strong foundation for a well - functioning society. They can  and should partner with business and government to reach communities, act as a check and  balance, and address issues or populations who are   being overlooked   or ignored.  Far from lacking influence, CSOs present great opportunities for multi stakeholder collaboration.  This is what we’ll explore further, in the next chapter.

Crisis of Capitalism, Technology Overreach, and Shifting World Order

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about three drivers of change: one economic, one technological, and one geopolitical. Understanding how these trends are evolving and the impacts they cause is essential for any organisation seeking long-term success. Population growth and resource constraints are certainties of the 21st century, impacting both society and the environment. The remaining four drivers of change - the crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, the shifting world order, and climate change - are uncertainties due to the interaction of complex human and natural systems, making them hard to predict. The crisis of capitalism involves fundamental flaws in economic systems, income inequality, stagnant wage growth, and concerns about productivity growth. Technology overreach refers to the challenges associated with advancing technology and how these are being deployed, including digital technology and its impact on social interactions, personal data, and societal control.The shifting world order signifies the rise of non-Western countries and the emergence of a more plural, diverse, and equitable global landscape. These change drivers manifest differently across various countries, underscoring the need for organisations, communities, and nations to comprehend the local context to navigate these challenges and redesign society for the better.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Crisis of Capitalism, Technology Overreach,  and Shifting World Order  Elaine Fernandez :  As explored in the previous chapter, population growth and resource constraints are two  certainties of the 21st century, one social, and the other environmental. So what about the  other four drivers of change?  This is where things get really interesting, because these are all uncertainties. Why? Because  their exact nature and the impact they are having on the world at any given time is largely  unpredictable, resulting from the interaction of complex human and na tural systems.  In this chapter, we'll discuss three social uncertainties, the crisis of capitalism, a crisis caused  by fundamental flaws in our economic systems, technology overreach, which explores the  problematic implementations of our material advancement, and the shi fting world order,  which demonstrates why geopolitics are central to finding sustainable, large scale solutions  to global challenges.  Chandran Nair:  So let's focus a bit on fiscal and monetary policy. The idea was that much of the problems that  we were faced after the financial crisis and the one before that in the, in the 90s, was to do  with the way governments were managing and growing their economie s and not dealing with  income inequality and the stagnation of wage growth and those things. There was also  concern about the lack of productivity growth in advanced economies, particularly in Europe  and the United States.  There was also awareness that there was a disconnect between the stock market and state  of the overall economy. But the stock market is not the economy of any country and cannot  be in the 21st century.  There were also concerns about the recurring financial risk, the crisis through contagion, how  technology was essentially aiding in abetting some of these recurring threats of financial crisis.  Then we had the issue of too big to fail. Investment banks tha t were so big that their failure  could not be tolerated by the governments because of the impacts it would have right across  the world.
  So bailouts were arranged, etc. and this was seen by many people in, in all societies as being  unfair. Many of them were over leveraged as well. And thus, any sort of disruption can result  in them being toppled and having huge social costs across various c ountries and regions.  So let's address the issue of, therefore, the ultimate crisis of capitalism as I see it, which is the  consumption issue. Our entire economic model is premised on essentially promoting  consumption. Rising populations in Asia, where we talked about the popul ation could be  something like 5.5 billion people, will inevitably consume more resources.  But if they continue to believe that they can consume relentlessly, as the machine of  capitalism continues to provide goods and services that are underpriced, you don't have to  be a rocket scientist to know that there is not enough to go around. And in my   first book,  Consumptionomics, I make it very clear, using examples, from meat consumption to car  ownership, right through to the way we underprice water, that this is not possible. The idea  that 5.5 billion Asians and two and a half billion Africans should   aspire to live   and consume  like the average American, Australian, or European is a great lie.  So if everyone lived like Americans, four Earths would be required. We're not saying that the  newcomers to the global economy, the two billion people who arrive in the next 30, 40 years,  and those who've been left behind for the last 30 years will have to   just remain poor.  That is not the discussion. They have a right to a better quality of life   –   electricity, healthcare,  water, sanitation, nutrition   –   but the challenge will be, how do we do it very differently?  Elaine Fernandez:  The next driver of change is technology overreach. There's no debate about the benefits of  technology in modern society. But there is increasing recognition of the risks associated with  the latest advances in technology. This is driving the urgent need to   raise awareness and  better manage the deployment of technology in the various spheres of life.  Chandran Nair:  The way we deploy technology, the way we control and direct it to serve human societies is  going to be one of the critical features of how we navigate the 21st century successfully. One  of the challenges we face is that the common perception is that techno logy is mainly digital  and digital technology is a panacea for all global problems.  Many of the critical technologies for human wellbeing are not available to large segments of  the human population. Most of us never think about water supply systems. Most of us never  think about sanitation. We don't even think about the technologies needed   to build homes  to withstand extreme weather conditions.
  So much technology is directed towards maintaining our extractive economies. Very good  example of this is how we deploy technologies to essentially track fish stocks. The same  technologies that could be used to protect fish. Fish stocks are essentially use d to go and  deplete them, to find the last bluefin tuna in the South Pacific, rather than to protect it.  For instance, e - commerce relies on pushing supply chains, exploiting workers, not pricing in  the wastage, not pricing in the stress on the workers, the distribution systems, the delivery  people, the carbon footprint, and all of these are significant extern alities. So whilst we might  on one hand', be in awe of how these technologies can get us all of these things that we want  cheaper.  And as our minds are fixated on this view that if something is cheaper for us, it is a net benefit.  So the question really is, what sort of society do we want and what sort of technologies are  critical to protecting societies, given what we've learned from   the pandemic, given what we're  aware of in terms of climate change? And what we all know is influencing the next generation  with regard to a complete overexposure to digital technology? Those are the questions we  need to ask, and these are questions that   society, that generations before us never had to  confront.  Regulators around the world are extremely concerned about the impact of digital technology  on all aspects of our society. Certain democracies are worried that digital technology is now  beginning to influence the very nature of the electoral process.   Personal data now has  become something that is used by companies in ways that we don't even understand to drive  profits and to almost manage us, to convince us to buy things that we don't need with money  we don't have.  All of   these things will change the very nature of our social interactions. So we have to be  extremely aware that societies are beginning to react. As the digital tech companies become  so strong, they become difficult to essentially even manage. You can see this   in the United  States as legislation tries to curb some of the excesses of the tech companies that run into a  huge amount of hurdles because of the power of the tech companies.  This is not to say that tech companies are bad, but with every technology, with every  economic activity, Ultimately, we have to decide how we manage them, where are the limits  to how digital technology essentially influences our lives.  Elaine Fernandez:  Let's move on to the complex field of international relations. Geopolitically speaking, we are  living through a transformative time. All our futures will be influenced by global power  dynamics, particularly as non - Western countries continue to develop and   become more  influential on the world stage.
  Let's take a look at what this really means.  Chandran Nair:  What do we mean by the rise of the rest? It's a term that is used to essentially describe the  majority of the world. The countries, the populations from across Asia, Middle East, Africa,  and Latin America, who were all part of empires before colonised, etc . till about 70 years ago.  In some instances, even just 50 years ago, where they were still part of large conflicts.  Now, Vietnam in Southeast Asia is a great example of a country that is part of the rise of the  rest, which in the 1970s endured one of the worst wars in modern times. And today, that  country is a beacon of hope, a country that is rising. If you have been t o Africa, you will  understand that Africa has changed so much.  Still, with huge challenges, but the Nigeria of today is a very different country from 30, 40  years ago   –   The Rise of the Rest.  So what we're seeing is what I call The Dawn of the Post - Western world. What would that  look like in which we do not just view a world in which there's a dominant USA and a dominant  China. It'll be a world in which there will be a diverse range of countrie s who are all very  prominent, actively playing part in the design of the geopolitics of the world, the economies  of the world, participating actively in the diplomacy that is needed to avoid conflict and it will  be one which is plural.  By plurality we mean countries that are not just affiliated to the Western bloc or to the non -  Western bloc, but which is fairer and more equitable. The question is what will that look like?  What will we need to do?  The challenge will be to navigate that challenge. In a peaceful way and to create the new  globalised world so that nation states can redesign themselves in the context of all the  existential threats and resource constraints that we are faced with.  Elaine Fernandez:  The crisis of capitalism, technology overreach, and the shifting world order are social  uncertainties that will have a significant impact on the way humanity organises itself in the  21st century. The good news is that these drivers of change aren't out of   our control. In fact,  what we know about them and how we think about them shapes our ability to manage them  and to ultimately redesign society for the better.  One important factor to bear in mind is that countries at different stages of development  experience the impacts of these trends in entirely different ways. These differences create
  the conditions and environment that your organisation, community, and country operate  within, which is why it's vital to build a greater understanding of how these change drivers  are playing out in your local context.

Are Globalisation and Capitalism the Same?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair broke down why he believes capitalism and globalisation are distinct phenomena, despite their many parallels.While globalisation is often associated with capitalism due to its historical ties with free market economics, it encompasses broader issues of culture, identity and social norms.Diverse approaches to globalisation exist, as exemplified by countries like China that have embraced it while maintaining their own economic structures and norms, diverging from the Western neoliberal model.Contrary to mainstream views, deregulation, liberalisation, and the presence of multinational corporations are not prerequisites for participation in the global economy, as even liberal economies are now imposing restrictions and barriers to foreign investment.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Are Globalisation and Capitalism the Same?  Rohan Hazell:  Understanding of globalisation often centres on business, commerce, and economic growth. As  a result, it’s often compared with the spread of capitalism around the world.  But is capitalism necessary for globalisation to occur? Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed  suggests that while capitalism and globalisation are related, they are not the same thing.  Chandran Nair:  Very often we see globalisation as something to do with business, trade, something to do with  commerce and things like that. And thus, it is often assumed that globalisation has something to  do with capitalism, irrespective of how you define it. Are they the same things? It's quite  important for you to start to think about these things much more carefully.  Globalisation and capitalism are related, but they're not the same thing. I've already made  reference to the fact that globalisation includes the issues of culture, the issues of identity, et  cetera. They're not necessarily simply to do with capitalism.  Free market economies, however, believe that globalisation is impossible without fully open  markets and the free flow of capital. That too is an assumption. Free market economies often  use this as an example to essentially promote neoliberal ideas out of the West. But other  countries are embracing globalisation, but with their own structures and their own norms, and  China is an example of that.  So, it's important to understand that. We should not subscribe to just one way of looking at  globalisation and then define globalisation simply through the narrow lens of free market  economics. It is much more expansive than that, and there are such things in markets. But not  all countries want to be open markets, and not all countries open to the free flow of capital.  
The other part of the mainstream view of globalisation, which is being questioned now and not  just being questioned, but also being discarded by former champions, was that countries need  to deregulate and liberalise their economies to be part of the global economy.  Now we are seeing that this is not true, that even the most liberal economies, or previously  liberal, have essentially shut their borders to investments from other countries. They have not  been open to deregulation, nor have they liberalised the economies. The classic example that  many of us would be aware of is how certain Chinese companies have been barred from the  USA, Australia and Europe.  And a key part of the globalisation mainstream narrative is that the success of the multinational  corporations is seen as the success of globalisation. In part that is true, but in part that is simply  a function of the fact that various countries in the developing world opened up their markets  with conditions and allowed multinationals to thrive as well.  The tension at the moment in China with US multinationals and European multinationals is a  very interesting one because if you talk to multinational companies, many of them, despite the  restrictions within China, which China is permitted to have because they want to define how the  economy is open, the multinational companies see China as a major market.  Similarly, a market like India is not open the same way, but no multinational would essentially  run away from a market like India even if India imposes certain restrictions and conditions for  their entry into the Indian market.  And finally, is financial integration needed for cultural or social connections or even for trade?  That's something that is often cited by the mainstream thinking about globalisation, that  financial integration is needed for cultural and social connections. This is not necessarily the  case and not even for trade.  So, globalisation is more than just financial markets, capitalism and multinational corporations.  Rohan Hazell:  Despite assumptions that a capitalist economic system is necessary for globalisation, the recent  development of non-Western countries has led to the recognition that other forms of economic  system can fit within the globalisation paradigm.  In particular, development models pursued by countries like China have shown that financial  integration isn’t always necessary for cultural and social connections, or even trade.

Taking Action: Applying the Doughnut 

### keyTakeaway
This chapter explores how cities, regions, and nations strive to align with the principles of Doughnut Economics. The Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL) offers tools for localities to adapt this model to their unique needs, aiming for a balance between thriving societies and ecological sustainability. The model encourages localities to balance their immediate aspirations with their global responsibilities, ensuring local actions do not detrimentally impact global ecological health or social wellbeing. Amsterdam, Leeds, and Barcelona are among the cities utilising the Doughnut model to guide their policies towards circularity, sustainability, and social equity, each tailoring the model to their specific needs. Civic organisations and communities are engaging with the Doughnut model, fostering conversations and actions towards sustainable living, from neighbourhood initiatives to city-wide plans.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Taking Action: Applying the Doughnut  Rohan Hazell:  Oxford economist, Kate Raworth, conceptualised Doughnut Economics as a diagram for human  prosperity, but it quickly captured the imagination of people eager to apply its principles to their  localities.  Through case studies from Amsterdam, Leeds, Bhutan, and others, Kate Raworth will explain how  the Doughnut's application in diverse contexts can help communities thrive within ecological  limits.  Kate Raworth:  I first drew the Doughnut diagram 10 years ago, and it was a concept for human prosperity as a  whole, but almost immediately people started saying, we want to try and put this into practice  here. What would it mean for our city or our region, or our nation   or our town to aim to live in  the Doughnut?  And so, at Doughnut Economics Action Lab, we've created a tool, precisely for any place to  explore doing that. I, I framed it here as a city, but I invite everybody to think of it as, as the place  at the scale that you are most interested in transforming f rom a nation right down to a  neighbourhood. So how can our city help bring humanity into the Doughnut?  First, we need to unroll the Doughnut, make some space for ourselves so we can go inside  between the social foundation and the ecological ceiling. So, we've got a canvas where we can  bring our ideas, experiences, imagination, and possibilities. Here's the   question now that we're  inside, how can our city or place become a home to thriving people in a thriving place while  respecting the wellbeing of all people and the health of the whole planet? That's a big complex  question, of course.  So, we break it into four lenses, and on the one side we've got the local aspirations of a place and  we need to always put them together with the global responsibilities of that place. So let me just  talk you through these four lenses briefly.
  Let's start with the local aspirations of people in the place. How can all the people of our city  thrive? What would it mean for everybody here to have health and education, housing, transport,  community, culture, respect, equity, voice, that everyone need s to be out of that hole in the  Doughnut? How would we need to transform the way we're currently living to ensure that no  one here is left falling short? That is a local conversation for the people of a place, drawing on  their own culture and history and p ossibilities.  Let's add to that. What would it mean for this place to be as generous as the wildland next door  and wherever you are, I invite you to think where is the wildland next door? Where is the, the  closest healthy nature, nature, truest to her own form with the   least possible disturbance of  humanity? Of course, humanity is disturbed nature everywhere. There's no true wildland. But  the healthiest natural habitat next door. Let's go there and then let's see what nature's genius is  in your place. Because everywhere   on planet Earth, nature has figured out how to sequester  carbon, how to cleanse the air. She houses biodiversity, she cycles the water and harvests solar  energy. She regulates the temperature from the treetops to the forest floor. She builds soil. She's  re generative by design, and she makes us feel at home.  What if we were to take what nature's doing in your local wildland as a performance standard,  an ecological performance standard of possibility where you are, and make that the performance  standard of the city? Can our city sequester as much carbon as the   forest next door? Can it  cleanse the air? Could it cool the treetops to the forest floor by eight degrees as nature may well  be doing on a hot day? Can we harvest solar energy for food production or for energy production  here? Can our cities make us feel a t home? These are the local aspirations of the portrait.  And of course, there are many places where you can go, and I would say the Nordics do quite  well on this. The air is clean, the schools are good, the WIFI’s great. We can swim in the harbour.  What's not to like?  There's another whole side of the story. Our global responsibilities to ensure that living well here  does not come at the expense of people or the planet worldwide. So, how do we make sure that  our city respects the health of the whole planet? Think of all   the food, clothes, electronics,  consumer goods, the construction materials that have been brought into your city or place, and  the stream of waste that will go out. That's the red overshoot of planetary boundaries that we  see on middle -   and high - income co untries, and they all need to come back within planetary  boundaries.
  This is why we need a circular or cyclical economy without waste. That's a massive challenge.  Also, while you still think of the global supply chains on food and electronics and clothing, think  of the people who made our phones, who assembled our laptops,   who stitched our clothes, who  picked and packed the food we eat. So workers in global supply chains. Think of people worldwide  who are impacted today by the climate change that we know is caused by our own lifestyles and  nations. Think of the future of ref ugees that we know is going to be incurred by the climate  impacts and breakdown happening now. How will they be greeted when they arrive, where we  live? How will be treated by policy and our cultural welcome? So these are the four lenses of  bringing the Do ughnut concept locally.  And we at Doughnut Economics Action Lab are working with city and places worldwide to put  this into practice. Let me give you some examples. We began in 2019, pre - COVID in Portland,  Philadelphia, Amsterdam. These are city politicians and community members   and they said it's  such a relief to be sitting together around a shared goal.  Back to that conversation about purpose, having a purpose. Can we all together see how we  could create our own vision of coming into this space? We worked with the city of Amsterdam,  which was the first to adopt the portrait and create their own city portr ait, and put the doughnut  as a concept at the heart of their vision for the city. A thriving, inclusive, regenerative city for all  residents, while respecting the planetary boundaries. They used it to create a circularity policy.  The Doughnut is the core concept, with strong ambitions for becoming a circular city, not just by  2050, but almost halfway there by 2030, and then putting it into practise in housing, in the textile  sector and in food. Early practise, there's also been the   rise of a civic network. In Amsterdam,  many organisations, over 100 got together and they said the Doughnut provides a shared goal  for all the different things we're doing.  So they are organising and also holding their policymakers to account, to keep moving. Other  cities and places have been inspired by what began there. The nation of Bhutan have told us that  they find the Doughnut a really interesting concept that sits alon gside their concept of Gross  National Happiness. And so we've been working both with the civil servants of Bhutan, but also  the city of Thumpu and the Paro region, to see how this can inform their current design of a new  city plan.  The city of Leeds in the UK have taken the Doughnut as a concept and created their own  downscaled concept to drive their transformation towards 2030. Can they become a socially  equitable, low carbon, just city by 2030? In Birmingham in the UK, there's an a mazing work going
  on at the community level. An organisation called Civic Square, bringing about transformation  street by street. A conversation amongst neighbours. How do we decarbonise our homes  together? How do we transform what we eat? How do we transform how we travel   and how we  heat our homes?  Creating really strong community conversations, inspiring local people who've never felt they  could have a say in an economic conversation to realise that this conversation is about their lives  and they are the speakers to be on the stage.  Nanaimo in Canada took the Doughnut and turned it into their own dashboard and are now using  it to assess different options and scenarios, not against a cost benefit analysis, but against a  Doughnut dashboard analysis, which possibility for our future of t ransport will best help bring us  into the doughnut. Ipoh in Malaysia has the ambition of being the first city in Asia to say that we  want to be a Doughnut city and heading in that direction. And so have started working with the  downscale Doughnut tools to   see how they need to bring about that transformation.  Barcelona and Spain have dived in and are creating a city portrait, gathering local data to see  where they're falling short, where they're overshooting so that they can monitor their own  progress over time on a journey of becoming a city that lives in the   Doughnut. Doughnut  Economics Action Lab exists because people around the world started playing with the Doughnut  seriously and wanting to put it into practice in their communities, in their cities, in their  businesses, in their schools.  If you're interested, you can visit our platform, which is open to anybody to join, or you can just  browse. And on that platform are the tools like the Doughnut Unrolled tool I've just introduced.  These are in the commons, so everybody is welcome to use th em. We simply ask as commoners  for reciprocity, please share back your innovations and share back your experience.  Rohan Hazell:  The challenge of new economic paradigms is translating them into tangible changes, from global  metropolises to local neighborhoods.  As Kate Raworth has shared, the Doughnut Economics Action Lab has provided many cities and  businesses with practical frameworks and tools for redesigning society in their own contexts,
  spanning four key areas: local aspirations, global responsibilities, regenerative design, and  distributive systems.

Alibaba’s “Secret Sauce”: Purpose, Harmony, & Dialectics

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong illustrated how Alibaba’s philosophical principles shaped its unique approach to business and innovation, and paved the way for its success.The philosophy or Tao of Alibaba is founded on three core principles; purpose, harmony, and dialectics, which has helped the company innovate for success.Purpose is crucial for aligning employees' efforts with a company's overarching mission. This purpose-driven approach helped Alibaba stay focused and mission-driven.The principle of harmony helps companies keep operations in balance with their environment. It allowed Alibaba to recognise its place within the larger business ecosystem, understanding the interdependencies within its supply chain and the broader market.Embracing a dialectical approach enables companies to create unique solutions by combining seemingly opposite concepts. Alibaba's ability to embrace contradictions and find strength in opposing forces facilitated innovative thinking that built transformative products and services.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Alibaba’s “Secret Sauce”: Purpose, Harmony, & Dialectics  Host:  A company's philosophy is the value system that shapes its approach to business and innovation.  A well - crafted philosophy can propel companies to new heights, while a misguided one can lead  them astray.  Let’s explore the philosophy, or more specifically, the “Tao” of one of the world’s most successful  companies, Alibaba. Not only is it the world's largest retailer and e - commerce platform, but  Alibaba also has ranked among the Top 10 most valuable brands,   globally.  To walk us through this, we’re joined by Brian Wong, former Special Assistant to the Chairman of  Alibaba Group, Jack Ma. Brian is the author of "The Tao of Alibaba", which explores the  company's foundational principles. He will illustrate how the company’s   Tao philosophy has  helped shape the conglomerate’s global growth and success.  Brian A. Wong:  The secret sauce of Alibaba I really linked it to the philosophy of Taoism, mainly because I saw  this as a sort of interlinking sort of philosophy that ran throughout the company. Obviously,  Taoism is a very deep and profound philosophy. But if we want to   simplify it, and I would break  it down into three areas.  First is the path and the way. And this is very much a principle that runs throughout Taoism, that  everything, everyone, every organisation has sort of a path or a way, and in what I call the  purpose.  The second concept is really a concept of harmony. Although Alibaba is an organization, it thinks  about itself in the context of a much larger universe, much like how Taoism talks about this  harmony within the universe and how you need to sort of fit withi n that bigger picture. And so  everything that Alibaba did throughout its sort of development thought about contextually this  ecosystem. And even in the early days, we brought in biologists and ecologists to share with us
  kind of how systems work. And then we laid that into how we think of ourselves as a business in  the larger context of suppliers, buyers, customers, partners, public sector, et cetera.  And then the third concept is really embracing contradictions. What we call dialectic. And this is  probably the most profound and also most complicated aspect of   Taoism, because   of its concept  of opposites, black and white, big and small, entrepreneurial, or sort of corporate. And what you  saw in the history of Alibaba is this ability to kind of embrace what are seemingly opposite  concepts and bring them together to create someth ing new.  And an example of that is just Alibaba as a company. It's the largest e - commerce company in the  world by gross merchandise value and turnover. But it's built off of this collection of the smallest  businesses in the markets. We went about building Alibaba u sing a charitable   heart but   using  business tactics. And most people think charities and business are polar opposites, but you can  blend the two and create something that's quite unique.  These three components really do play into the situation we have today, a rapidly   changing,  unpredictable   sort of business environment, but also sort of a geopolitical situation that is also  very different from what we had in the past. So if you think about the path or the way or purpose  of an organisation, this mission - driven sense of any company is really t he guiding light for an  organisation and its people.  But at the same time, being able to be flexible and work between different sorts of polarities.  This, when we talk about embracing contradictions, it’s like you're constantly adjusting and  adapting, yet at the same time, you have a very clear direction as   to where you want to go. And  then in the context of this harmony, it's really thinking about how each of the factors of your  environment affect your business.  So I would say that for companies, particularly in this environment, having these elements helps  them adapt and adjust, but also stay on track, because there is a danger of going off track to  follow something in a short term basis or making a rash decision , but then losing sight or  forgetting that there is a longer term focus that needs to kind of also guide your organisation.  I think the normal reaction is to resort to a kind of black and white or what they call reductionist  views, because that's also often how many of us are trained, particularly in the West. That's also  why I kind of framed the book I wrote on Alibaba's manag ement principles within a philosophical  approach, because the cultural context also helps adapt your thinking.
  Things are in shades of gr e y or within ranges, not just one or the other. And in some ways, we  need to unlearn what we've learned in certain environments and then contextualise it, but also  realise that as the world becomes more complex, we have to have more nuanced ways of looking  at and solving challenges.  Host:  Whatever you call it — the Tao, the way, or the path — the philosophy your organisation embraces,  will ultimately dictate its trajectory and determine its success.  As Brian shared, in the case of Alibaba, this philosophy was distilled into three core principles:  Purpose, Harmony, and Dialectics. Inculcating a sense of purpose across all levels of the  organisation enabled employees to align their efforts with the comp any's overarching mission.  The principle of harmony allowed Alibaba to recognise its place within the larger ecosystems it  operates in by focusing on understanding the interdependencies within its supply chain and the  broader market.  And embracing dialectics, or the acceptance of contradictions, empowered Alibaba to find  strength in opposing forces, which encouraged innovative thinking that created unique solutions.

Humanising Supply Chains: Lessons from LabourNet

### keyTakeaway
By going beyond skills development and addressing 'adjacencies' like housing and healthcare, your organisation can elevate its supply chain’s well-being and productivity.By recognising the worth of supply chain workers and advocating for their fair treatment, you can play a part in establishing a more ethical work environment, resulting in higher retention, greater business value, and a positive community influence.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Humanising Supply Chains: Lessons from LabourNet  Elaine Fernandez:  Organisations worldwide are grappling with increasingly rigorous ESG standards, and one area that is  receiving greater attention is how they manage their supply chains.  In this case study, we'll explore how companies can adapt and respond to increasing scrutiny of their  supply chains. Governments and NGOs globally are ramping up pressure on companies to be more  accountable for the treatment, training and overall   wellbeing   of people working in their supply chains.  So, what steps can be taken to improve supply chain management, whilst ensuring the workforce also  has the necessary skills, capabilities and support to achieve both individual and organisational  success?  This is a critical question, given that many workers in extended global supply chains are employed  informally, without proper contracts or training, are not covered by social protection, and often work  in precarious conditions.  For most of the 20th century, the demand for cheaper goods and services meant the most  disadvantaged workers faced downward cost pressures resulting in poor pay, unhealthy work  environments and unfair treatment.  In the 21st century, these practices have come under the spotlight. Stakeholders across the spectrum  are   demanding   a   more   ethical,   transparent,   and   human - focused   approach   to   supply   chain  management. Let's look at an example of a highly successful social en terprise in India called  LabourNet.  To date, LabourNet has provided skills training and access to basic needs for over 1 million people.  Through their innovative, human - centred approach, LabourNet has also helped hundreds of Indian  and global companies optimise and humanise their supply chains for the better.  Since 2006, LabourNet has been offering skills development and livelihood support to informal  workers with the aim of enhancing their employability, dignity and overall   wellbeing .   LabourNet also  partners with companies looking to source staff from their pool of workers using AI systems and tests  to match skills with business needs.   They also help manage the implementation of fair contracts and  ongoing upskilling for new placements. This purpose - led, performance driven approach has won  LabourNet many big - nam e clients inside and outside of India, including the likes of Mahindra, Unilever,  Bayer and Honda.  LabourNet has recognised that skills development, while essential, is not sufficient to nurture effective  supply chain workforces. As a result, it has taken a ground - up approach to improving supply chains by  addressing "adjacencies".
  Adjacencies are the interconnected factors that improve the overall employability and well - being of  workers, helping them to thrive in competitive supply chains.  In lower income countries, this means ensuring access to basic needs like housing, education, and  nutrition. Let's hear more from Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO of LabourNet.  Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan:  In the last two to three years, we've also been touching on the adjacencies levels. For example, does  finance, does housing, does healthcare have implications on how a student is able to partake skill  training and therefore be qualified for it or for a wor ker to have better retention rates. That means  the employer   will   get a better retention rate if we work on adjacencies.  Elaine Fernandez:  Beyond upskilling, there are four other areas of adjacency. First, housing conditions. Better housing  can positively impact   workers' overall well - being, attracting them to stay in the formal sector and keep  productivity levels high.  Second, appropriate healthcare. Access to affordable healthcare and health insurance is crucial for  workers' quality of life and ability to perform at consistently high levels.  Third, effective transportation. Mobility is vital for workers to access gainful job opportunities,  particularly in rural or suburban areas.  Fourth, being able to manage finances. By providing access to financial services, such as bank accounts  and microloans, workers can have greater financial stability and security.  As Dr. Vasudevan has said, when these adjacencies are addressed, workforces rapidly improve their  performance, stay in jobs longer, and ultimately create value for their businesses, families, and  communities.  For this reason, companies with supply chains that extend into electronics, automobiles, construction,  oil and gas, retail, telecommunications, and healthcare have all got on board with Lab ourN et's model  of taking a more holistic approach to investing in the livelihoods of the people they employ.  The LabourNet case study provides an excellent example of how simply seeking the cheapest, leanest,  and fastest supply chain is by no means the most humane approach ,   n or is it best practice for  companies seeking to attract, nurture, and retain the best talent in frontline roles. Workers at each  stage of the supply chain should be seen as partners and valuable contributors in the creation of a  company's final product or   service.  Fundamentally, this means providing decent work which according to the International Labour  Organisation, involves giving people opportunities for work that is productive and delivers fair income,  workplace security, and social protection. It should give t hem better prospects for personal  development, and the freedom to express their ideas, and participate in the decisions that affect their  lives.
  As LabourNet has demonstrated, going one step further than the basic requirements and investing in  the livelihoods of employees along the supply chain pays dividends. Employers reap great benefits in  terms of productivity, loyalty, and the knowledge that t hey are having a positive impact on the  societies in which they operate.

Driving Multistakeholder Collaboration: CSO’s Unique Position

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, KAM Morshed highlighted how civil society can leverage its uniquely positioned role to drive multistakeholder collaboration by acting as a bridge between businesses, governments, and communities.Businesses, governments, and civil society, each have varying motivations, risk tolerances, and time horizons, but ultimately often pursue similar goals. Despite differences, aligning on a common vision and measurement techniques is crucial for effective collaboration.Due to its community-level presence and flexibility, civil society is often better positioned to conduct initial problem-solving, take risks, and implement new initiatives.Multistakeholder collaborations can effectively address large-scale challenges by leveraging each party's strengths and resources, leading to efficient and impactful outcomes.CSOs need to articulate their value proposition in terms that resonate with businesses and governments, focusing on practical benefits and alignment with their objectives rather than moral appeals.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Driving Multistakeholder Collaboration:  CSO’s Unique Position  Host:  In the fight to address poverty, no single stakeholder, whether in the public or private sectors or  even civil society, is equipped to do it on their own. With a multistakeholder approach, the task  becomes more achievable.  The challenge is, how do you bring together different stakeholders, each with their own KPIs and  objectives, to pursue a common goal?  This is where CSOs can leverage their unique position to consolidate the talent, resources and  the capabilities of cross - sectoral stakeholders.  In the case of BRAC, an international development organisation that works with marginalised  communities across Asia and   Africa, this often   means engaging with   governments and  businesses.  To provide more clarity, BRAC's senior director Mr. KAM Morshed will now explain how CSOs can  drive multistakeholder collaboration.  KAM Morshed:  So on the business side, I think business organisations as a whole and development organisations,  sometimes the government if you also bring them into the picture, have different types of risk  tolerance, different time horizons to operate, different motiva tion as well.  Businesses, you can say, are mostly motivated by the bottom line. Government has a different  motivation, often, much of it is political. NGOs have a different motivation, different what success  looks like for all these three might be described differently,   but if you hear them closely, they are  basically talking about the same thing.
  What works is setting and talking to each of them, finding out what is the end goal, have a  common shared vision and also agree on a measurement technique of how this implementation  of the vision will be measured. What BRAC has done and worked well is BRAC   took the initiative  to develop a model. Businesses often are not interested.  Governments are sometimes shy of trying new ways of working. So I think there is a huge role  for NGOs and not - for - profits. These three parties can work in almost a sandboxing environment.  When you have three different types of actors and when you get them   to collaborate, somebody  needs to absorb the risk of it, somebody needs to take the first step. And I see NGOs are better  suited to take the first step because the government works in the entire country.  Any wrong step by the government affects millions of people. NGOS on the other hand work in  community, in partnership with the community. I think NGOs are in a better position to first take  the first step. Design a small initiative, but keep all these two   partners involved from the design  space.  But I think one advantage that BRAC has after 52 years in this country, NGO that was born in this  country and you know, is becoming a trusted name in the public sphere. It was probably a bit  easy for BRAC, as a convener, to get these three parts to come to   a room. The other advantage  that BRAC, as I have said, is that we are also in business, we are in the private sector as well. So  we also have inroads, easier inroads to reach to the private sector.  During the Covid - 19 pandemic in Bangladesh, so soon after this pandemic started their office  closure so on and so forth, we realised that one important thing that needs to be done is contact  tracing. So BRAC approached the government. All your health worke rs are busy treating the  patients, you don't have enough spares ready who can go door to door in the entire country and  contact trace. So we said, okay, BRAC is interested in doing contact tracing for COVID - 19 and so  we can quickly come up with an agreemen t. And then with that, BRAC did the contact tracing,  we maintained the data and then every day, we uploaded the data to the government system so  that the government can take the next step.  When it comes to vaccination, mass vaccination, the same thing happens that the government  has doctors, nurses, paramedics who can administer the vaccine. But managing thousands and  thousands of vaccination centres which were set up ad hoc, was not somethi ng that the  government could do. So, we are present all across the country, in all communities. So when  there's a clear competitive advantage of BRAC, of managing the centre, registering the people,  giving them the date and time when to come, where to come   and government to administer the
  vaccines and so on and so forth, so we work together, there's a clear vision, clear division of  labour.  Similarly, during the same time, when COVID induced a lot of economic downturn, the lower  echelon of the society financially became almost destitute. And then other private entities  wanted to do something. But due to COVID their business activity was low,   many of their staff  were on vacation or on leave and they were downsizing. They need somebody who can identify  the most marginalised family and provide them the support that they are willing to contribute  to. So that was a clear case when the private secto r and BRAC started working together.  Government is fantastic when it comes to doing something on a large scale, you know, covering  all the people in this country under a health scheme. But then the government knows that there  are pockets, there are nuances and there is. If they want to reach   a point where nobody is left  behind, they need a much more nimble infrastructure which is difficult for the government to  arrange and maintain. And also the government needs to prioritise so many other things.  So again, NGOs need to be able to present that to the government in a language that the  government understands. I have seen that if you do that, if you talk in their language and present  the case that they understand and that they evaluate, it generally wo rks well. I think one simple  answer is to make use of civil society and NGO's advantage.  Businessmen understand this perfectly well. So if NGOs can offer better value, meaning better  results at a lower cost, it makes all the business sense for them to work with NGOs. I think it is  critical that NGOs see themselves as a service. So NGO talk the ir language, talk business language  and present a business case instead of making a moral claim that this is why you must work with  us.  NGOs have some advantages. We are present in the grassroots. For a business to go into  grassroots is a huge investment. We know exactly the pain points that people are facing.  Businesses want to know that, but really knowing that in real time is highly exp ensive. That  appeals to the businesses. All the CSR activities that businesses are engaged in can be done  probably much better if it is done by organisations who are better suited to do this. For the  government, the same argument.
  Host:  Governments, businesses, and NGOs each have their own motives, priorities, and appetite for  risk , which can make it difficult to foster collaboration between these groups.  As Mr. Morshed described, this is where CSO’s higher threshold for risk can expedite  collaborations. CSOs tend to enjoy a greater degree of public trust and can act as a convener to  bring stakeholders together.  The key lesson Mr. Morshed is sharing is to communicate with potential collaborators in a  language they understand, helping them to realise why it’s in their best interest to work alongside  you for mutual benefit.

The Policy Gap: Is regulation for technology needed?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson highlighted the crucial role of policy in shaping the responsible development and application of technology.Policy is often seen as an “enemy of innovation,” but if wielded correctly, it can act as a foundational guide for technology, ensuring research, development, and commercialisation in alignment with societal goals.The complexity of emerging technologies like AI necessitates sophisticated regulatory frameworks developed by authorities with deep technological understanding to navigate potential disruptions.Guarding against regulatory capture is essential to maintain the integrity of policymaking, ensuring they reflect the public interest and not just the priorities of influential industry players.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Policy Gap: Is regulation for technology needed?  Tsubasa Nair:  For all its benefits in the pursuit of progress, technological advancement has historically paid  little heed to its social and ethical implications. Whether its the damaging influence of social  media or the ethical quandaries of artificial intelligence, history has shown us that when left to  its   own   volition,   tech   can   disrupt   societies,   exacerbate   inequalities   and   even   threaten  fundamental rights.  So the question is, how do we ensure that technology serves society rather than disrupt it?  This is where policy comes in. To shed more light on the critical relationship between tech and  policy, let's now hear from Eric Stryson, managing director of the Global Institute for Tomorrow.  Eric Stryson:  I think policy is fundamental to how we understand and how we experience technology. And it  starts with really the research and development that goes into new technologies and their  application.  We should remember that it is good government policy that guides and enables the initial  development,   the   research   and   development,   and   then   the   application   and   the  commercialisation of technology, which is of course driven by incentives and then fueled by  investment. And that holds for all technologies, not simply the latest technologies like digital  mobile connectivity and now AI. It holds for electrification. So simply prioritising electrification  to remote parts of the country.  It holds for the provision of water treatment and wastewater treatment systems, and the  provision of clean water. Indeed, it even is related to the provision of affordable housing. And  there are solutions for affordable housing through prefabricated modular housing, et cetera.  But that requires good, clear, effective policy.  
I think in addition to R&D, the government actually sets the priority for building infrastructure  upon which much of the technology is then developed and deployed. And it can facilitate the  expansion of a technology or it can constrain and regulate a technology if it is expected to cause  harm or if it is unproven and unpredictable.  I think the government also plays an essential role in responding to citizen concerns around the  societal impacts of technology, the new business models around delivery apps and drivers, not  just for taxis and e-hailing, but on demand delivery services of food and goods, etc. essentially  creating a vast labour class that is unprotected, that is beholden to algorithms.  This causes great concern and potential for societal disruption, which therefore policy needs to  respond to in protecting the vulnerable and protecting public good in society, essentially  enhancing fairness and equity within society. I think one of the things that is underestimated is  the need for competent regulatory capacity in understanding and therefore setting policy and  shaping policy to guide and regulate, particularly new technologies.  And I think it is coming to light quite obviously now that there is a lack of expertise within the  regulatory establishment and the policy establishment for understanding and setting good  policy for the new tools based on artificial intelligence. And I think this has great potential for  causing societal disruption if it is not managed well.  The last thing I would say about policymaking is that there is a great risk of regulatory capture if  policymaking and the capabilities are not strong enough. It's very easy for industry to step in  and play a leading role in setting that policy. And then therefore, there is a risk that the rules will  be established in preference to industry leaders and at the expense of other members of  society. And I think this is a risk that needs to be avoided.  Again, we tend to think about policy in relation to the kind of most cutting edge technologies  that we are excited about or that we're experiencing. And at this moment that happens to be  artificial intelligence and the various applications of AI, of advanced digital technologies. But  policy, arguably, it's more essential role is in enabling the distribution of the foundational  technologies that society at large is still lacking. And that again, relates to things like the basics  of clean water and sanitation, access to safe and secure food, access to safe and secure housing,  a minimum standard of consistent electricity. And these basic needs are still lacking in many  countries   and   in   many   cities.   The   estimation   of   those   living   in   urban   and   peri   urban  environments who are underserved, meaning they are lacking in some of these basic needs, is  
estimated to be about one in four people who live in cities are underserved, and that is rising  and may reach about one in three by mid century.  So we need to remember that actually the essential nature of policy for technology is the  distribution of foundational technologies to all people in society, in addition to trying to  properly manage and regulate the cutting edge technologies which we are so obsessed about.  Tsubasa Nair:  Contrary   to   popular belief, policy is not the enemy of technological progress. At times,  government investment has spurred some vital technologies like the Internet and vaccine, and  at other times has protected against negative impacts of technology. Policy also plays the  inalienable   role   of   ensuring   that   the   benefits   of   technological   advancements   are   not  concentrated in the hands of a few, and can reach all corners of society.  Where it is up to technological innovation to push boundaries, it falls to regulation to incentivise  businesses while ensuring responsible development, and ultimately steer technology towards  serving society's best interests.

AI “Snake Oil”: Discerning Fact from Fiction 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong explored the principles of deploying AI effectively, emphasising the importance of aligning model inputs with expected outputs to optimise results and avoid inefficiencies.Effectively leveraging AI to your organisation's benefit demands comprehension of basic underlying principles and the parameters within which such technologies are developed, tested, and validated, to avoid being swayed by exaggerated claims or flashy features.There are three fundamental elements to AI: data, algorithm, and computing power. From an application standpoint, understanding the algorithm in depth is less crucial than being critically aware of the data it processes.The Targeted Questioning of Data (TQD) methodology is a strategic tool to enhance the quality and relevance of data used in AI systems. TQD encourages users to critically assess the quality of data, its sources, and its appropriateness for the task at hand. This ensures that the data not only supports the AI’s tasks but also aligns with the intended outcomes.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  AI “Snake Oil”: Discerning Fact from Fiction  Tsubasa Nair:  Throughout history, technological breakthroughs have been accompanied by all manner of  useless, fake, and even damaging products, claiming to be the real deal.  AI will be no different, and in fact, this challenge will only worsen as the technology’s  capabilities continue to exceed our expectations and familiarity.  So how can we discern fact from fiction, in a world increasingly saturated with AI promises?  To help answer this question, we’re now joined by Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed. Dan has been the  CEO of an AI-focused business and has driven and implemented over 30 AI projects at the global  transport company, MTR, for which he was GM of Global Innovation.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University, where he teaches a course on  AI and Product Innovation.  Dan will explore the hype surrounding AI, and will provide an indicator of trustworthy AI  solutions through examination of data.  Dan Wong:  Technology seems to go into cycles of exuberance, followed by despair. And this is a trend that  has been famously captured by Gartner in what's known as the Gartner hype cycle. This is  something that Gartner publishes each year for different technologies, and it shows the trend  that we see repeated.  When a new technology comes out, there's a natural excitement around the possibility, and  there then tends to be an overreaction to the expectation for technology, followed by then,  despair. It's not meeting the expectation. And this is a similar thing that we see for AI, especially  given all the news that seems to be coming out around the new capabilities of AI. And the  question then becomes, is really AI the solution for everything? Can it really perform at a level  that we expect?  
There's a term called "snake oil". So snake oil is a historical term, which really means that it is  fake. It doesn't work. That's what snake oil means. And the history is that in the 18th century,  there were lots of products and belief that snake oil is the solution to everything. It cures all  diseases, and it's great for health. And so all sorts of products magically appeared with snake oil  in it. But it turns out that, number one, snake oil doesn't work and has no health benefits, and  even the products that claim to have them don't have snake oil.  And so one thing for us to think about now is, is AI the new snake oil? It's very natural for all of  us to be wrapped up in the excitement around AI and to actually believe that this new  technology will now solve all the problems that we couldn't solve before. So how do we assess  whether or not AI can solve a particular problem? Is AI really a silver bullet? And it is really our  responsibility as leaders to filter that out.  On the one hand, we know that for our organisations, AI is a very, very powerful technology and  we need to find the right way to use it to enhance our competitiveness, to help us reach our  objectives. On the other hand, there's a lot of wasted cost involved in deploying AI in areas  where it doesn't work. To illustrate this point, many, many organisations face the challenge of  too many applications to have to physically look through the CVs, too many people applying to  actually interview each person individually. And so there are solutions that will do this for you  using machines that can be done at scale.  Let's take the example of algorithmic assessment tools for video interviews. In addition to what  the candidate is saying, AI can now analyse how it's being said, analyse the expressions,  emotional state and delivery of the candidate. And there's also an expectation that this is a  machine and so machines should be unbiased. Machines are not inherently racist. And so from  these different angles, this seems like a very, very good solution and in some ways it is and in  some ways it is not. And this is where we need to then be careful about distinguishing the snake  oil from the non-snake oil.  A very natural expectation on this tool is, you know what, this is actually helping me to find the  most effective employee of my organisation, meaning that this is the person after they join will  have the best job performance. And if you really dig into this, you really dig into the data used  to train these models, then you would think, is this really the data they use? Do they actually, in  the training of these modules, take data of candidates and then actually track them in terms of  real performance over time?  
And what you'll find out if you start asking these questions, actually, you know what, in some  ways they do not. The vendors that provide these tools very often do not have access to this  very sensitive information. Organisations typically even working with a vendor will not provide  this very proprietary information to the vendor, which means that in most cases, these solution  providers do not have data that maps actual performance to the actual candidate.  In some cases there's a blind belief, you know, whatever the machine provides is something that  I should believe because it is unbiased. It really comes back to really understanding the data.  And the way that machine learning algorithms AI works, is really composed of three key  components.  One component is data. Second component is the algorithm inside the black box. The third  component is the computing power, the hardware horsepower you use to compute. These are  three inseparable core elements of AI to deliver its performance. Of these three components,  there's one clear winner. There's one clear component that makes the most impact to the actual  performance of an AI model as it relates to deploying it in live use for business. And that is the  data.  The data is the most critical piece here, which is also good news for all of us. Data is something  that anybody can understand. Anybody can start asking common sense questions about the  nature of data. There's a tool I'd like to introduce, which I like to call the targeted questioning of  data. TQD.  TQD is not a formal theory used by any particular academic organisation, but it is something  that has been gathered by live use. Something that has been collected from lots of real  experience deploying AI into scenarios. When you have any kind of a user scenario, including  the case study here around these algorithmic assessment tools, focus your attention on  common   sense   questions   that   help   you   understand.   Do   you   really   trust   that the data  encapsulated there can provide the outcome you want to assess? For example, data that does  not include any kind of performance metrics, can that really then tell you the right candidate?  And is that your expectation for this tool?  In other words, what are the types of applications that are legitimate, it may not be legitimate.  It may require further exploration. Is really the target question of data, understanding whether  or not you trust that data, and whether or not that data encapsulates the required information  to bring the outcome that you want.  
Tsubasa Nair:  As Dan has highlighted, by understanding some basic underlying principles of AI, we can avoid  being swayed by exaggerated claims or flashy features.  By asking the right questions about how these technologies were developed, tested, and  validated, we can peel back the layers of marketing to reveal the substance—or the lack of  substance.  Effective   AI   solutions   can   actually   demonstrate   tangible   benefits,   such   as   efficiency  improvements, cost reductions, or enhanced decision-making capabilities, rather than just  promising revolutionary changes.

The Rise of  the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani highlighted the West’s response to a shifting world order, and how non-Western nations find their place in it. The past two centuries of Western domination in global affairs were an aberration in human history. Before colonialism, Asian economies were historically dominant, and the post-Western world represents a return to this historical norm.Many Western political and intellectual leaders are reluctant to acknowledge or accept the transition to a post-Western world.Asia’s emerging powers have benefitted from embracing Western ideologies such as free market economics, which have helped facilitate their resurgence to power.Western nations, particularly the United States, have worked to undermine the very international rules-based order they established, through actions like withdrawing from international agreements and reducing funding to multilateral organisations to weaken institutions that uphold global governance.As the West constitutes only 12% of the global population, it is ultimately in its own best interests to strengthen the multilateral rules-based order; to ensure all participants abide by the same rules.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Rise of the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  The post-Western world order is one in which rising powers from Asia, Africa and South America  will have more influence on the global stage.  But, as we are already seeing, this transition is causing friction between nations.  Many non-Western countries feel that the rules and institutions of the current world order  don’t serve them well.  On the other hand, Western nations feel that their systems are best, and are therefore reluctant  to share power by departing from the status quo.  So, how will this play out?  How should the West respond to this shift, and how can non-Western nations find their place in  the post-Western world?  Statesman and global thought leader, Professor Kishore Mahbubani, helps us answer these  questions.  He was Singapore’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and the former President  of the United Nations Security Council.  He is also a Distinguished Fellow at the Asian Research Institute, National University of  Singapore, and shares with us his insights, built on a   wealth of experience in the major  geopolitical developments that have shaped recent history.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  Well, we are in the midst of a major transition away from 200 years of Western domination of  world history, and it's important to emphasise that the past 200 years of Western domination of  world history have been a major historical aberration. Because from the year 1 to the year 1820,  
the two largest economies of the world were always those from Asia, the two largest Asian  economies of China and India.  The post-Western world is therefore a return to the natural norm of human history. That's the  most important thing we need to know, and especially for people in the West who, as you know,  are still resisting the idea that we are moving into a post-Western world.  For the people in the West who are resisting this change, I think the first thing I want to tell  them is that they should not be frightened of this move towards a post-Western world because  all the new rising powers are rising also in part because they have absorbed Western pillars of  Western wisdom. You know, ideas like free market economics, rule of law, or rules-based  international order. And many of the new rising Asian powers are not seeking revenge against  the West. They actually want to work with the West to create a better world. So, the  post-Western world, which will be a more prosperous world, will also create opportunities for  the Western societies.  But this is an idea of course, that no Western politician dares to speak about. I don't know of  any American politician who was prepared to say: “Hey, you're going to move into a world  where America is no longer number one”. I mean, that's going to happen, but no American  politician can say that. I mean, it's shocking.  And similarly, I think many European states are also in a state of denial about the fact that we  are moving to a post-Western world. I find that quite amazing. So, I think it will still take some  time before the leaders of the West, both the political and intellectual leaders of the West,  learn to treat Asia with greater respect.  I actually wrote a book. It was called "The New Asian Hemisphere”, which explained why there's  a resurgence of Asia taking place. And I do emphasise in that book that the Asian countries  should send the West thank you note for their return and their success because they have  actually taken on board many Western ideas that have facilitated their return and resurgence.  So, one obvious idea is the idea of free market economics. And we live today in a shocking  world where barely 30 years ago, it was the United States that was preaching the virtues of free  trade and free trade agreement. And China at that time was reluctant to sign free trade  agreements to open up its economy. That was at the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.  Now, what's amazing is that 30 years later, it is the United States that cannot sign a free trade  agreement. It has withdrawn from the Trans Pacific Partnership, and by contrast, it is China that  is now prepared to join free trade agreements. And China has joined the world's largest free  trade   agreement   -   The   Regional   Comprehensive   Economic   Partnership   (RCEP),   which   is  promoted by the ASEAN countries.  
I think the important thing to emphasise is that the Asian countries have benefited from the  1945 rules-based order that was created by the West. I served as, you know, as Singapore’s  ambassador to the UN for over 10 years. The most shocking thing I learned as Singapore's  ambassador to the UN is that it was the Western countries, especially the United States, that  was trying to undermine the Western rules-based international order because the rules of the  Western rules-based international order were constraining the United States from exercising  unilateral power on its own.  And unfortunately the European countries who ought to have known better and who should  have resisted these American efforts to undermine the rules-based international order did not  do so at all. And in fact, they supported American efforts to undermine the rules-based  international order. And I'll give you some concrete examples.  So, for example, it was the United States that walked away from the World Court which is set up  by American lawyers and American ideas. And the Europeans should have worked harder to  persuade the United States to stay in the World Court and they failed to do so.  And similarly to give another example, I've discovered that the way the United States tried to  weaken the United Nations was by depriving it of its oxygen. And the oxygen of the United  Nations is money. You need money to pay for all the programs to improve the world. And the  United States fought ferociously to stop the United Nations of funding.  And here again, the European countries aided and abetted this efforts of the United States and I  want to emphasise that when the United States weakens an organisation like the World Health  Organisation - by the way, to make it absolutely clear. Technically in the 1970s, about 70% of the  funding of the World Health Organisation came from compulsory assessed funding and only  about 20% came from voluntary funding. 50 years later it’s the opposite now. Only 18% of the  funding comes from compulsory funding, and 70-80% is voluntary funding. You can't build an  organisation with voluntary funding in the long run.  I wrote another book called The Great Convergence, which explains how the West was  systematically weakening these multilateral organisations, these United Nation organisations.  But I want to emphasise that the United States is acting against its own interests when it  weakens the UN and when it weakens the multilateral forum. Because at the end of the day,  since the Western countries make up only 12% of the world's population then it's in their  interest to strengthen the multilateral rules-based order because that multilateral rules-based  order will ensure that all of us abide by the same rules. And it's such a tragedy that the West has  been undermining the UN for over 30, 40 years.  Rohan Hazell:  
Before the Western colonial period the largest economies have always been Asian, mainly due  to their size.  The post-Western world will see a return to this state, and Western societies should not fear  this change.  Yet, there is clearly some resistance in the West, where international rules have been designed  to favour Western nations.  The fact is, many rising powers have applied Western approaches to market economics, rule of  law, and the rules-based international order, and they want to work with the West, not against  it, to create a better world.

Pricing Externalities

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair discussed the importance and complexities of pricing externalities, as well as the other tools governments can use to address externalities effectively and ensure sustainable resource management.An equitable pricing model should reflect the true cost of resource use, charging higher rates for greater production and consumption to discourage wastage and ensure fairness across socioeconomic groups.However, managing externalities doesn't necessarily mean increasing the overall cost of goods and services. Rather, it involves adjusting pricing structures to accurately reflect resource usage and encourage sustainable consumption patterns, without negatively impacting the economy or disadvantaged groups.In addition to pricing mechanisms, outright bans and regulations may be needed to manage negative impacts on society.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Pricing Externalities  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are fundamentally an economic issue and are therefore inseparable from pricing.  For example, if a cigarette company paid for the public healthcare expenditure it caused by  causing respiratory illness and cancer, this would be “internalising” an externality.  But, as Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, will discuss, this isn’t the only way pricing can be  used to tackle externalities.  Chandran Nair:  Well, pricing is not the only way to do it. There's a whole range of other economic instruments  that you can use to essentially try and abate the sort of externalities that you think have a  negative impact. That's the role of the government. So pricing is one. In other circumstances,  outright bans. And that's nothing new either.  There have been outright bans on many things. There are certain chemicals today you can't use.  DDT and various other things you can't use because the science caught up, governments caught  up with the science and essentially decided we can't have these. So there's outright bans too,  and then there's other ways of doing it, which is to educate people on how to use these things  as well.  So I think we have to think about this more from the point of view of how we can price things in  certain ways, we can make certain things not available in the markets because it is judged to be  damaging to society. And then we have to look at things whereby regulations drive a complete  redesign of the goods and services that create externalities that cannot be tolerated.  When we talk about pricing externalities, we need to understand, when you start pricing  externalities, it doesn't mean the price of everything goes up. It starts to essentially level out  how people consume. Let's take an example, for instance.  
The way we price water is an interesting example. Today you could be running a large factory in  a city and you will pay less for that water than a resident in a poor area, unless that water is  illegally mined or something like that. Because our whole economic model is to allow the  factory to produce more cheaply by under-pricing the basic resource, in this instance, water.  So we all know that archaic economic theory, the more you use, the cheaper it is. So what we  actually ought to be doing is saying, the more you use, the more goods you're producing, we're  going to charge you more for the water because those goods and services that you produce  need to be tempered in the pricing because there's so much wastage anyway in the way we use  that.  The more you use, the cheaper you use it, the cheaper the goods and products people just  waste. And at the same time, the people who can't afford it get less because the usage is taken  up by the big users and they pay the same price and they can't afford it. So, there's lots we can  do with this, but that's just an example of how we can price externalities, and it's actually not  going to affect the economy in the same way that's typically argued. And governments need to  bring in all kinds of pricing mechanisms, but also other ways to ensure that pricing mechanisms  do not affect the ability of the disenfranchised to have access to goods and services that are  essential to them.  Elaine Fernandez:  Government has a variety of tools at its disposal to manage externalities, in addition to pricing.  Whatever tools are deployed to this end, it is important to ensure that legislation increases  access to basic needs amongst the most vulnerable members in society.  A common concern about managing or “internalising" externalities is that it would increase the  cost of production and in turn consumers would have to pay more for their goods and services.  However, as Chandran has pointed out, a more equitable pricing model would charge higher  rates for greater consumption to reflect the true cost of resource use and discourage wastage,  without negatively impacting the economy or the access of disadvantaged groups to essential  goods and services.

The Impacts of Political Meritocracy on Poverty Alleviation

### keyTakeaway
This chapter highlighted China's approach to poverty alleviation and economic growth through political meritocracy. Professor Daniel Bell described China’s shift from prioritising economic growth, even amidst corruption, to addressing more complex issues like environmental pollution and social inequality. In the reform period, China focused on selecting public officials who could deliver economic growth, using market mechanisms and empowering farmers to alleviate poverty. Despite corruption in China during the 1970s and 80s, leaders still worked towards economic growth, unlike in other countries where corruption led to stagnation. This approach gradually eroded political legitimacy, leading to a forceful anti-corruption campaign in recent years. China's challenges have evolved beyond poverty reduction to include environmental issues, climate change, and social inequality. Public officials are now assessed using varied metrics, like environmental performance. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Impacts of Political Meritocracy  on Poverty Alleviation  Elaine Fernandez:  China has demonstrated perhaps the most remarkable poverty alleviation programme in history,  having uplifted nearly a billion people out of poverty.  Professor Daniel Bell, Chair of Political Theory at the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law,  suggests that China’s system of political meritocracy helped enable this transformation.  You’ll hear from him about how China tackled the poverty challenge, and the need the nation  now has for experimentation and openness in coming up with new policy approaches for other  challenges.  Professor Daniel Bell:  In the case of poverty, I   mean, in   the period of reform, there was an assumption that the best  way of reducing poverty is economic growth. Therefore, we should select and promote public  officials   who   can   deliver   economic   growth.   And   that   means,   you   know,   for   example,  implementing market me chanisms, giving more farmers the right to sell their products, but also  promoting public officials according to their ability to deliver economic growth. In an electoral  democracy, voters choose whoever they want, or often the powerful people who have mor e  power to decide who are the leaders.  And it might not be the same emphasis on delivering economic growth. Now, at a certain point,  corruption became a serious threat to the political system, because as I've mentioned, I mean, if  you're a political meritocracy as a public official, you're supp osed to be serving the political  community, if you're serving yourself, your family, it means that you're not doing what you're  supposed to do. So the whole political system would gradually lack legitimacy. So that's one  reason why there's been this very f orceful effort to attack corruption over the past 10 years.
  What's interesting now is that the poverty alleviation campaign is still ongoing.   There are   still  pockets of China where there's severe poverty and public officials are rewarded more directly  according to their ability to reduce poverty. But now China's problems are much more diverse.  It's not just poverty reduction. I mean, environmental pollut ion, it's climate change, it's reducing  gap between rich and poor. At least ideally, there are different ways of promoting public officials,  not just according to ability to reduce poverty or deliver economic growth, but in some places,  for example, it wou ld be like in the city of Hangzhou, using environmental matrix as a way of  promoting public officials.  In some areas, too, it would be ability to reduce the gap between rich and poor. So the issues are  much more complex now and involve not just poverty reduction. Now, frankly, because the issues  are more complex, it also means that there's a need for more e xperimentation, especially at  intermediate levels of government, where sometimes it's unclear what's the best way, what  should be the metrics used to promote public officials, because it really depends on what's the  most urgent priority for that area. And   sometimes it's environmental priorities, sometimes it's  poverty reduction, as mentioned.  So there's different ways of assessing performance of public officials. And there's also a need for  a more, let's say, open environment so that people can make their preferences known more, and  also so that there's more debate about what works and what doe sn't, because issues are much  more complex. So my view is, even though there's been a tightening of the political environment  the past few years, but I do think that eventually there'll be more openness just because the  issues are much more complex.  And we have to ask why has there been tightening of the political environment? I think it's related  partly to the anti - corruption campaign, because the public officials at the top feel every time you  launch an anti - corruption campaign, you're creating enem ies. And that naturally makes them a  little bit more, let's say, careful, if not paranoid.  Elaine Fernandez:  One of the most visible ways political meritocracy has worked in China is through the reduction  of poverty. Public officials have historically been promoted based on their ability to uplift their  constituencies economically.
  Nowadays, public officials are being promoted based on their ability to manage contemporary  issues like environmental pollution, climate change and income inequality. This has seen the rise  of more experimentation within the government to determine what wo rks best for China.

Addressing Climate Change: The Investment Case

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned how investing in addressing climate change, while potentially less profitable in the short-term, is ultimately in the best interest of a business’s long-term viability.1. The private sector has a crucial role to play in tackling climate change - investing in climate cannot just be a CSR activity.2. While initial costs for green investments may be higher, fewer costs are incurred over a longer period of time through reduced consumption, including of water and energy.3. Such projects, which emphasise resilience in their solutions, make a strong case, especially in the medium to long-term, for investors to consider climate-friendly investment options.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Addressing Climate Change: The Investment Case  Elaine Fernandez:  The prevailing business sentiment to what investing in sustainable development is that it is  unprofitable and requires vast quantities of startup capital. But contrary to popular belief, this  isn't always the case. And a growing number of pioneering business leaders are now challenging  this narrative. To help us understand the role of business in responding to societal challenges,  you'll hear from one of those leaders, Vivek Pathak, Global Head and Director of Climate  Business at the International Finance Corporation, or the IFC.  A seasoned finance professional who has led advisory and investment operations across 18  countries, Vivek's current role involves mobilising capital to help countries decarbonise their  economies and adapt to a warming planet.  Vivek Pathak:  My current role is an interesting one. I've got a small team, about 50 people that I work with,  and we've got three or four key functions that we focus on. So one, which is, I think probably  the most interesting for me, is we're really looking at what the climate space is going to be like  tomorrow. So green hydrogen is an emerging space. Electric vehicles, storage technologies. How  do you decarbonise steel and cement at scale? How do you get more capital into biodiversity  and nature-based solutions?  So   things   that   are   not   happening   today   at   scale. So, for example, solar and wind are  mainstreamed. My team doesn't focus a lot on that. So really, it's really looking at the new areas  of growth in climate and what tomorrow looks like. So that's really what I would say is what I  enjoy doing, and that's really a large part of my work.  The second is, along with the World Bank, we've committed to align all our operations in line  with the Paris Agreement. For us, it's going to be between 2023 and 2025. So I've got a team  that's focusing, which means client by client, we work with our clients to get their operations  aligned with the Paris Agreement.  
A third part of what we do is really working on taxonomies and standard setting. Standard  setting is critical if we have to attract capital at scale into these sectors in emerging markets. So  we spent a lot of time doing that. Green loans, we worked with green bonds, we've recently  come out with our blue finance guidelines. So a lot of standard settings. And third is we've got a  climate finance function where we review all the climate work that IFC is doing to say that it's  really the independent pair of eyes which classifies and tags an investment as climate or not  climate. So this is very broadly what we do in this group today.  I mean, time is running out. People say the planet is at risk. The planet is not at risk. The planet  has existed for billions of years and it will. It's the dinosaurs that disappeared. So it's humans  that are at risk, in my view. And I think business or the private sector has to play a crucial role,  because if you look at the balance sheets of countries, unfortunately due to COVID and now due  to the energy crisis, the countries have taken on a lot of debt and a lot of the solutions have to  come from the private sector. And in order to make that happen, we need to demonstrate that  investing in climate is not a CSR activity. And I believe this was a huge damage done to this  space, till about 15 years ago it was a CSR activity. It actually makes good business sense in the  medium to long term. A lot of these things are going to cost you money today, but the fruits of  this will come over the next few years.  And I'll give you a simple example of something that we see everyday. Green buildings. Now, to  construct a green building in emerging markets, we've developed our own tool called "Edge."  And there is an upfront cost because it costs more to construct. There are additional things that  you have to do to make it green. The payback period for green buildings, depending on the  market, has now come down. I would argue between two to three and a half or maximum four  years. After that, because it's a green building, your energy costs are lower, your water  consumption is lower, and you manage your waste better. So it's basically energy and water,  which means your energy and your water bills are going to be low, which means you have more  access to free cash flow.  So a lot of things in climate that we are trying to mainstream actually make a lot of good  business sense. Now, there are some areas where technologies are untried and tested, or  they're hugely expensive. So those are the areas where you need a little more support or  concessional capital, or blended finance, as we call it. But essentially, climate has to make good  business sense in the medium to long term. It's not a short-term play. If you're a short-term  investor, that's not the space for you because the returns are going to take time. So that's one  part of it. The other part is if you're actually investing in certain sectors, you run the risk of  stranded assets. So that's something that you need to look at is what sector are you investing  
in? Can it be decarbonised today? And sometimes, like I said earlier, the upfront costs may be  higher, but the payback is going to come. Then you look at climate risk, which is, unfortunately,  it's taken a lot of disasters and a huge toll in human life for people to recognise that. I mean,  we've seen the floods in Pakistan recently, we've seen the typhoons in Florida, in Europe, in the  Philippines. Now, there are ways that you may not be able to prevent these but there are direct  links, I think.  But it's really, how do you build an economy that makes it more resilient to some of these  climate risks? So for example, if sea waters are rising, you can build sea walls to help protect the  coastal communities. If a certain area is more prone to flooding, you can actually put storm  water drainage. We've recently launched a tool in the Philippines called Building Resilience  Index, the BRI. And what that does is it helps the construction company or the developer to say,  what are the climate risks? And how can I, at the design stage, construct this building to protect  you or make it resilient to a large part of these climate risks?  So that's really, in a nutshell what I think we need to be looking at.  Elaine Fernandez:  Although initial cost for green investments may be higher, such as in green housing projects,  fewer costs are incurred over a longer period of time for reduced consumption, including of  water and energy. This is made possible because these projects emphasise resilience in their  solutions, making a strong case, especially in the medium to long term, for investors to consider  climate friendly investment options.

The Untapped Potential of Africa: Its People

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Obiora Ike highlighted Africa's potential in a post-Western world, emphasising the significance of its youthful population, vast natural resources, and the need for good governance and equitable global partnerships.Africa's future lies in its large youthful population. With 65-70% of Africans under the age of 30, the continent has a significant demographic advantage to drive innovation and economic growth.Despite extensive exploitation, Africa's resources and talents remain largely untapped for the benefit of its people. Professor Ike emphasises the importance of recognising past injustices while providing opportunities for Africans to contribute meaningfully to the global community.There is a need for improved governance across African nations, and its younger generation, who are more ethically inclined, is poised to lead the continent towards a brighter and more equitable future.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Untapped Potential of Africa: Its People  Host:  As non - Western countries like China, India, Nigeria, Indonesia and Korea rise in economic and  cultural influence, the global power structure is tilting towards multipolarity.  This provides nations of the African continent with a unique opportunity to redefine their role on  the global stage.  To illustrate Africa’s bright future, let’s hear from Professor Obiora Ike.  Professor Ike is a world leader in the field of ethics. He is a Professor of Ethics and Intercultural  Studies at the Godfrey Okoye University in Enugu State, Nigeria, and a Founding Director of the  Catholic Institute of Development, Justice, Peace and Cari tas.  Professor Obiora Ike:  The future of humanity is in human beings. Africa is the one continent that has more human  beings bringing them into the world. You have a population of 65% of Africans are youth below  the ages of 30. No other continent is growing in terms of a future buil t on hope. Because when  there are human beings, young people, then you can plan for the next many years, because there  is hope.  So the African continent is that continent that is bringing in fresh young human beings into the  global village who will be of service. The African continent with its resources, and these resources  have been exploited in the past millennia. They are not ex hausted, but they have never been  used for the people of the continent. So a world conscience will emerge that tries to say, you  know what, we are all brothers and sisters. We must agree that these people have been badly  treated and we must give them back   what belongs to them.  Africa has never had any restitution given to it. And the whole world owes Africa. But Africa is  not even after that. Africa is just saying, allow me to be and allow me to contribute, because  there are a lot of talents who can contribute, and as many of th em are allowed. One sees what's
  already happening in the US, in China, in Australia, in Europe especially. And so what Africans are  doing, once given a chance to contribute their own quarter.  I mean, I'm a product of Europe. I lived in Germany, I've been teaching in Germany, and I've  worked in Switzerland and other places. And I see how we, as people of African descent, are able  to contribute to the world when they say, add your voice, when the y allow us to do so, because  often you are not allowed. So these are the things we must consider.  We see that the African continent and peoples, they are resilient, and you need resilient people,  people who are eager to contribute. Just give me a space.   Da mihi locum ad standum et ego  saltem mundum movebo . The Latin will say, give me a place to stand, and I will at least move the  world. Africans want to move the world. They are asking for access and on governance. The young  people of today are not going to be as their fathers in terms of bad governance. Th ese young  people want a better   world,   and they are going to have their chance because they are taking over  the plenary in the next few years.  And you can be sure that the world of the African people will be a better world. This is what Africa  can offer to the rest of the world. And we are very eager to go into a dialogue to make sure that  on win - win levels, win, win. Not I - take - it - all, no, let's   respect each other. Let's play it fair. The  things we preach, let's practise them.  Host:  The coming decades are poised to be a transformative era for Africa.  One of the main drivers of this shift is the continent’s growing and talented youth demographic.  While many high - income countries grapple with ageing populations and declining birth rates,  Africa stands out with the youngest population globally — over 60% of   its people are under the  age of 25. This youthful segment presents an unparalleled opportunity for innovation, cultural  enrichment, and dynamic economic growth.  However, for the youth of Africa to unleash their potential, there are barriers they must  overcome.  First, incorrect stereotypes need to be cast aside so that African youth can be given an  opportunity to contribute. Professor Ike has worked around the world and witnessed first - hand  the abilities of the African diaspora.
  Second, as with most countries, governance systems across many African nations are in need of  an overhaul. As Professor Ike puts it, coming generations are better educated in ethics and will  become capable leaders of their nations, leading to a brighter fu ture for the continent.

Addressing Externalities: The Business Case

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned how addressing externalities is ultimately in a business’s best interest, particularly given the shifting expectations of an increasingly conscious populace.Companies seeking to make their business activities more sustainable need to recognise and account for the externalities in their business models.This can be accomplished if businesses take the necessary steps to identify, measure, and mitigate these externalities in tandem with policies and regulations that incentivise action.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Addressing Externalities: The Business Case  Elaine Fernandez:  A key factor in redesigning society is the impact of externalities, the true cost of doing business  that are borne by society and the environment. Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer of DBS  Group, explains why it is critical that companies account for the externalities of their business  model and how these efforts can be supported by technology and the right incentives.  Piyush Gupta:  Let me first address for your students the question of what is the problem and how do we get  there. Then second, we can talk about where science and energy are going, and then finally I'm  going to talk about pricing and how to create incentive structures. On the first, I think this idea  of externalities and being able to price for externalities seems to be straightforward, by and  large it is. But I think an example helps.  When you think about what a company does, right. We buy goods, we add something, we  manufacture, we sell goods, et cetera. If somebody had to just step back and describe our  activities and say, what good did you do? How were you relevant? You would actually put in a  lot of variables into that discussion. You would not start with saying, oh, you made a billion  dollars in profit. You would say, oh, you created jobs for people. You would say, satisfied  customer needs. You would say, you did a whole bunch of qualitative dimensions for helping  something or other. People will be able to describe it fully.  Unfortunately, we've chosen to go down a path where in accounting, we can't capture all of that  nuance in that discussion. So what our accounting does only captures what appears on the  profit and loss of the balance sheet of the company, which are the financial aggregates of how  much, what did you sell, how much was it worth, how much did it cost you to produce, et  cetera, et cetera. Everything else disappears when you look at the accounts and we've got to  the stage, therefore, that these accounts basically determine all our thinking about what did the  company do? Was the company worthwhile? Did it make an impact, or not make an impact?  We've simplified the process for good reason. For good reason, because we didn't know any  
other way to actually capture the rest of the nuance into something somebody else could  understand and compare and use in a meaningful way.  Now, if you look at the business we do, there is an example. You take the palm oil industry, I've  spoken about it before. We finance palm oil industries. We put in guardrails to make sure the  palm oil industry is done in a meaningful way. It's not leading to burning, it's not leading to  climate issues, et cetera. Nevertheless, financing that industry comes with pluses and minuses.  The biggest one is a loss of biodiversity. To put palm oil together, most of it is in Indonesia and  Malaysia. You actually get rid of the natural tropical rainforest and you replace it with palm oil  trees. And you could argue that there'd be some difference in the carbon sequestration, but  there's still trees. The biggest difference is in biodiversity loss. You lose that.  So that's a big negative. It's not captured, it's not measured. So when we say palm oil, that cost  doesn't show up. But at the same time, what it also does is there are about 15 or 20 million  small stakeholder farmers who the government of Indonesia, for example, transmigrated from  Kalimantan to Sumatra 30 to 40 years ago. Poor people. And they give them all one acre  hectare, a small acreage of palm oil to make their living. There are millions, 14 to 15 million of  them. The entire livelihood comes from this. By selling the palm oil, it's the only way they  educate the children, they look after the health care, they have a future, they get out of the  poverty line. So there's a massive upside on a social standpoint for the people who rely on this  as the principal basis of earnings. Leave alone, and I'm not an expert, but you could argue  globally, people would argue that palm oil is actually a very good oil for a lot of the things that  we make for consumption and is better than many of the alternatives that people use.  Now, if I had to capture this discussion and put it all into an accounting statement, it'd be very  hard. How do I value the kid’s life? How do I value the kid’s capacity to get educated? How do I  value healthcare improvement? How do I value literacy? So there's a positive externality and  there's a negative externality of biodiversity loss and maybe some carbon loss.  Now we've got to be able to figure out what's better. Put together some sum, is this good for all  of us or is it bad for others? And that is what we're trying to figure out . When I say that, you  know, the externalities don't get measured, that's a problem. That's a good example to figure  out what the problem is. Now, why do I feel somewhat more optimistic that we started thinking  about how to capture this? Certainly some of these in the past were very difficult to measure.  How much carbon do you create? What is biodiversity loss? How do you put a value on that?  And could you translate it into understandable terms? Could you even figure out what is the  footprint of your mangrove forest or loss or your palm oil estate?  
Today, technology has gotten to the stage where these things are possible. So through GPS,  through lidar laser systems, through infrared, through QR technology, you can tag every plant,  you can track the estate, you can tag the plantation, you can see where the forest cover went,  you can see what grew, you can see how big the trees are. These are possible to do even in the  air. You can figure out, to start measuring how much carbon dioxide has been created, you can  create models around it. We couldn't do much of this stuff 5 to 10 years ago. Today, with  fintech, digital technology, sensor technology, we moved a long way. And you can do a lot of  these things. On the positive externalities, there is no technological way to do it, but those have  always been easier to dimension.  You put activists, you put people on the ground, they can start measuring improvement in  education levels, longitudinal studies on social welfare, healthcare. It takes some effort. But  today I think we've got to the state where if not now, then in the near future, we can get our  hands around putting some things that you could actually measure and actually capturing them  exactly as you capture the financial account. So I think that is progress. The question is, what  will incentivise people to start doing this?  The impact-weighted accounting is really that we don't just look at the financials, we look at all  of this stuff as well. And so you've got to start incentivising people to do that. Part of the answer  to that is regulatory. A large part of what you can do is at a multinational, national level, you can  get agencies and authorities to mandate that you need to provide this kind of information. And I  think to a large extent, you're going to have to do that. In most countries, you're beginning to  get to a stage where the mandates are to give disclosures. Disclose various things with respect  to your ESG practices and so on. So it's beginning to improve, it's not entirely there yet. But  eventually   what   you   need   to   do   is   to   create   the   right   incentives, and a lot of them,  unfortunately, are financial incentives for people to be able to not just measure and disclose  this, but to use that in the decision-making. And those financial incentives, again, can only be  created in reality by government policy.  We take today, a big realisation in the need to be net zero, let's say. Today, 3,000 companies in  the last couple of years have signed up for net zero commitments for 2050. My own sense is  that many of them don't know how to achieve it. And so obviously the first agenda is to help  them build low carbon business models to try and get there. But at the same time, I also believe  that many of them will not be able to get there because the technology can't support it. They  don't know how to avoid carbon, they don't have a glide path. In those cases, the best way to  achieve their intent and agenda is to create a carbon market. So to me a carbon market or  
carbon trading is like any other form of outsourcing. I do some things myself because I'm good  at it and the things that I do not do myself, I pay for somebody else to do it for me. That's the  easiest way to think about this incentive system. So if you say look I will do what I can beyond  the point, the next marginal carbon save I can do is not worth it. It's much better for me to give  the money to somebody else to save the carbon for me. Netted, the planet will improve.  So some of it, the financial incentives will happen if you start pricing carbon and if you create a  carbon market you will get natural incentives. But you can also create the incentives through,  like I said, policy action. So you can put taxes on carbon, that's a policy action. You can change  the cost of financing high carbon activities by changing capital requirements. That's a policy  action.  So I think that's the third leg of the stool. So you've got to first get to the realisation that there  are externalities. You've got to use the tools to measure them and you have to have a mandate  to start disclosing them. But finally you've got to put together incentive mechanisms which are  often driven by policy actions which will force people to allocate the capital, time and resources  in the most legitimate and meaningful way.  Elaine Fernandez:  Companies seeking to make their business activities more sustainable need to recognise and  account for the externalities in their business models. Piyush proposes that this can be  accomplished if businesses take the necessary steps to identify, measure and mitigate these  externalities in tandem with policies and regulations that incentivise action.

Sustainability Myths: Part 1

### keyTakeaway
We explored two “myths” about sustainability: that a universal understanding of sustainability exists, and that consumption-driven growth can be “green.”Myth #1: A Universal Understanding of Sustainability- “One size fits all” sustainability solutions are very unrealistic. Solutions need to be tailored to local contexts.- International sustainability efforts should respect national sovereignty and local conditions, as governments are more likely to commit to frameworks that benefit their people and economies.Myth #2: Consumption-driven Growth can be “Green”- Growth should enhance wellbeing and respect planetary boundaries, not just focus on unlimited economic expansion.- Technological advancements in efficiency can conversely lead to increased consumption of resources. For example, more fuel-efficient cars can lead to more driving and, ultimately, higher overall fossil fuel demand.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Sustainability Myths: Part 1  Elaine Fernandez:  Dr. Goodall and Professor Sachs have laid out some of the key sustainability challenges we  face. The global effort to address these challenges are diverse, but they're not always  effective. There are many myths and misconceptions around sustainability whic h can confuse  governments, businesses and the average person alike. It's important to identify and clarify  these misconceptions because they shape policymaking and regulation from government,  strategy and investment decisions in business, and ultimately, t he way our economies are  managed and run.  The four main myths which Dr. Goodall and Professor Sachs both alluded to are one, that  there   is   a   universal   understanding   and   implementation   of   sustainability.   Two,   that  consumption - driven growth can be sustainable at all. Three, that market mechanisms ca n  effectively solve sustainability challenges. And four, that technological development is a  panacea for sustainability.  In this chapter, we'll explore the first two, a universal understanding of sustainability and the  unsustainable nature of consumption - driven growth.  The timeline of sustainability's origins mainly highlights Western thinkers and institutions   and  overlooks the broader global context. The belief that Western nations and institutions are the  sole leaders in sustainability efforts, or that their approaches are universally applicable, has  persisted for decades. In fact, there is a wealth of knowle dge and approaches from around  the world that differ from mainstream understandings of sustainability that originated in the  West.  The reality is sustainability is inherently contextual. Local factors, including development  levels, socioeconomic needs, cultural norms and political systems all greatly influence how  sustainability is defined and pursued. What may be a sustainable practi ce in one region might  not apply elsewhere.  For example, in higher income countries, children increasingly need access to laptops or other  devices to enable their education. This is something that the One Laptop Per Child initiative  sought to bring to lower income nations starting in 2005. The aim w as to give children access  to education that would improve their life outcomes. But put simply, it failed. Training was  not provided to use the laptops, nor were curriculums designed around the sudden injection  of technology like this. As one dignitary fro m Cameroon said about the initiative, "What is  needed first is clean water and real schools."
  To foster true global sustainability, it is imperative to not only recognise that local conditions  will dictate the decision - making of governments and businesses, but also to acknowledge and  respect the diversity of approaches that different countries adop t. Instead of imposing one -  size - fits - all standards or overly criticising alternate practices, international cooperation  should support nations on their distinct sustainability journeys.  Criticism can inadvertently hinder progress by failing to consider local realities and alienating  governments and entire populations. After all, it is the government's mandate to create  conducive conditions that incentivise and enforce sustainability. Stat es will only agree to  international sustainability frameworks if they respect national sovereignty and believe it will  result in a net benefit for their people and economies. This is an especially important point  because international efforts to address su stainability challenges, from tackling climate  change to reducing poor working conditions in supply chains, have repeatedly fallen short of  achieving desired outcomes. A major reason for this shortfall is because governments have  either been unwilling or u nable to make the trade - offs needed to accelerate sustainability.  In conclusion, the misconception that sustainability efforts are pioneered exclusively by  Western   or   higher   income   societies,   neglects   the   diverse   and   contextual   nature   of  sustainability. Appreciating different types of knowledge, embracing localised appro aches,  respecting national sovereignty, and exchanging best practices can pave the way for a more  inclusive and effective global sustainability movement.  A core element of this lies in how economic growth is perceived to be inextricably linked to  consumption of resources. This is what we'll explore in the next myth.  The second big myth to debunk is that consumption - driven growth can still be green or  sustainable. The reality is, on a planet of finite resources, infinite growth is a physical  impossibility. Economic growth is one of the few universal political objective s. From Albania  to Zambia, global governments and the businesses they regulate all focus on growth. This is  not an inherently bad thing, as economies and societies should be growing in a positive  direction. The challenge is to decouple economic growth from   the consumption of finite  resources.  One strategy is to reconsider our metrics for economic success. GDP, while a valuable  indicator, fails to capture unpaid work and non - market activity that contributes to wellbeing,  such as homemaking and childcare, as well as the impact of economic growth   on the  environment. Alternative metrics such as Gross National Happiness, GNH, or the Genuine  Progress Indicator, GPI, incorporate wellbeing, equity and environmental sustainability into  their calculations. By prioritising these metrics, nations can pursue   policies that promote  sustainable practices, equitable growth and improve overall quality of life.  Another approach to decoupling growth from resource consumption is the adoption of a  circular economy. The circular economy seeks to minimise waste and make the most of
  existing resources by emphasising recycling, reusing goods and reducing waste. This approach  shifts the focus from a linear "take - make - dispose" model to a circular one where resources  are conserved and the lifespan of products is extended. Importantly, cir cular economies go  beyond simply improving the efficiency of our consumption.  Many of us believe that resource efficiency will help address the issues associated with  consumption - driven growth, but it remains a short - term solution. In fact, there's an economic  theory that describes why. The Jevons Paradox, named after the 19th centu ry economist  William Stanley Jevons, illustrates how increased energy efficiency can lead to an unexpected  and counterintuitive outcome   -   higher consumption of fossil fuels. Here's why.  When technological advancements lead to increased efficiency in resource use, the overall  consumption of that resource tends to rise rather than decline. In other words, as we make  our processes and products more energy - efficient, it becomes cheaper to use   energy, leading  to its greater consumption. For example, consider the development of more fuel - efficient  cars. While these vehicles consume less fuel per mile, they often become more affordable to  operate, thereby encouraging people to drive more frequent ly. Consequently, the initial gains  in energy efficiency are offset by the increased consumption, resulting in a higher overall  demand for fossil fuels.  In summary, sustainable prosperity does not mean unlimited growth, but rather growth that  enhances wellbeing while respecting planetary boundaries.  In the next chapter, we'll look at the remaining two big myths of sustainability, which focus  on markets and technology.

Trade-Offs and Individual Responsibility

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the overlooked trade-offs inherent in modern conveniences and the collective responsibility of society in addressing them.Many of the conveniences brought about by modern goods and services come with trade-offs, where the benefits gained often come at the expense of unnoticed or unaddressed negative consequences. For example,  it is cheaper to produce virgin plastic than to recycle plastic, leading to immense wastage.Individuals should embrace knowledge about externalities and take responsibility for addressing them in their personal and professional lives.Every component of society, from governments and private businesses to NGOs and individuals, bears a collective responsibility to address externalities through sustained action, dialogue, and influence within communities.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Trade-O   s and Individual Responsibility  Elaine Fernandez:  Managing externalities is often seen as a responsibility of governments and businesses.  But as externalities also arise in the process of consumption, like smoking cigarettes in public  places, individuals also play an important role, too.  In this chapter, Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, discusses how we should all be more  responsible in the way we consume goods and services, in order to reduce unintended  consequences on society and the environment.  Chandran Nair:  Well, when we think about externalities, there are many trade-offs that we can think of. Let's  look at food delivery apps. There's a major cost that is buried in there that most of us just  ignore. But the trade-off is this. All that junk in the wrappings, the plastics, the carbon footprint  of the delivery system, which is huge, particularly in parts of Asia where many of these  deliveries were done by poorer workers.  What I call, you know, in many ways, essential workers are paid very low wages. That's an  externality. So the trade-off is simply this, the convenience that we all gained, the upside of I  don't need to go to the supermarket. I don't need to go and expose myself during the  pandemic, but there is a trade-off here.  And the trade-off was a huge amount of externalities, which I've just mentioned, that people  don't care when people buy things. You know, there's a golden rule. If you price things too  cheap, people don't value it. And food became so undervalued, so much of it was wasted. So  these are the trade-offs. These are simple examples.  The question is, what can I do? I'm a professional. I work in a company. I want to contribute. So  what can they do? I think the first thing you do is you got to essentially embrace the knowledge.  
You know, you got to really understand. I just gave an example of our contemporary life hidden  in that a huge amount of externalities, a huge amount of injustice we have to redesign this. So  that's the one part.  So when you get that knowledge and you begin to map it all out, then in your professional life,  you start to outline to your peers, to your bosses, your business partners, how are we dealing  with this?  One of the great problems we have today is so few are willing to intellectually engage in this  very honest conversation. And the whole GIFT.ed thing about redesigning society is about  intellectual honesty. You have to cut deep, you have to relearn. And much of the learning we've  had over the last decades has conveniently concealed and hidden away the concept of  externalities, and we can't run away from it. So as an individual, first, get the knowledge.  Second, decide that you want to do something about it.  You don't have to be the outlier or mainstream, bring it into the organisation, but bring it with  knowledge and solutions. And what we are trying to do is get you to first understand the  knowledge, get you to understand the responsibilities. Because with leadership there are  responsibilities and we have to act responsibly and then bring your education, your skill sets to  ask very difficult questions. Because a redesign will not take place if we ask the most simple  questions or we remain in denial.  And finally, I would say as an individual, start influencing your communities. People are really  interested, they just need to have that basic understanding and then we start to make changes.  But it comes from boldness, it comes from being curious. And that's what we're trying to infuse  in all of you.  Elaine Fernandez:  Although governments must take the lead, solving the externalities challenge is a society wide  endeavour that requires committed and sustained action from the public, private and NGO  sectors as well as individuals like you and I.  With   the   willingness   to   ask   difficult questions and engage in conversations within your  professional and personal circles, you can influence change in organisations of which you are a  part.

The Future of Globalisation in the Post-Western World

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned from Professor Wang Hui about the various aspects of globalisation and Westernisation, and how these will adapt in a multipolar world.Globalisation is not a new phenomenon and has occurred in different waves throughout recorded history, as seen from the 13th to the 15th century, and at various points in early Chinese history.After the 15th century, Western countries came to dominate global affairs through colonialism and maritime expansion. This dominance led to the imposition of Western rules and orders on other nations, shaping the global system we know today.De-Westernisation is not anti-Western in sentiment, but rather a shift towards creating a more equitable and inclusive global order, instead of replacing one form of centralised power with another.Solidarity based on recognising and respecting differences in political systems, ideologies, cultures, and social structures is crucial for fostering more equitable relations.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Future of Globalisation in the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  The Western-led world order’s focus on open markets and trade liberalisation helped facilitate  globalisation. However, the rise of emerging economies like India and China is challenging  power dynamics within the global supply chains we rely on today.  The question is, how will globalisation adapt and evolve in a multipolar world? To illuminate  how this might play out, we have Professor Wang Hui of Tsinghua University, Beijing.  Professor Wang Hui:  De-globalisation, in different terms and in different ways, is a phenomenon seen in our own  history. A lot of people talk about, for example, the 13th to 15th century globalisation. And  actually, in our times, in Chinese history, there was a long process of the global connections very  early on, and many people talked about it like a tributary system and defined that as a kind of  global system too.  So a global system is not necessarily a Western system, but why do people talk about  de-Westernisation? I can understand it partly because these waves after the 16th century, with  colonialism, the colonial time and the so-called maritime era coming, the European countries  became dominant, the Atlantic powers became dominant, and they imposed their rules and  orders over other countries.  So when you use Westernisation, there are some implications for the history itself. And also we  need to rethink the alternatives. De-Westernisation is a Western centralism. It's not replaced by  some other centralism, but trying to replace it by a certain more equitable, more inclusive  order, which shares something for the world. Obviously, it's not anti-Western, but it tries to  create more equitable global relations.  Here in Chinese, we often talk about one term. In Chinese, it's "Héhé   和合 ". The Sanskrit, for  example, "Samyoga" or the "Samadhi" are the Buddhist terms for solidarity, and also based on  
the difference, which means that it's not only the Chinese, like Confucianism, Taoism, but also  the Indian culture and some others. I think that there are a lot of cultural elements here to think  about these issues. So these are the first, I think. There are a lot of people, even from the  Western countries, who talk a lot about multilateralism and the plural civilisations and so on  and so forth, which I think is a shared wisdom.  What kind of rules-based order, who made the rules, whether or not there was a certain kind of  participation by the different parts of the world in making those rules. So we need to think  about the decision-making and the rules-making process. It is very important. The UN, for  example, a lot of people talk about the UN reform, for example, whether or not the small  countries, for example, or different social groups will have the voice in the rule-making process,  so that when we talk about the rules-based order, we need to question the rule-making  process. Is it more democratic, or only dominated by a single power, or some group of powers  for their domination?  It's difficult to avoid that, because once they want to keep maintaining their monopoly power. I  think that it's difficult to say that basically what we want is not anti-Western, absolutely not. But  a certain kind of the change of the monopoly structure. It's much more important.  In that sense, democracy at the global level is important, which means that the different  countries, different cultures, have some voices in the new world. So that's the long process. I  think that since the domination shaped anti-domination process is already there, it's not  anti-Western, but trying to transform the power structures in the world.  If you talk about a new alliance, it's fine, but I prefer the term solidarity to the term alliance or  allies, partly because the term alliance, or especially the term ally, was repeatedly used by  Western politicians, because basically the idea of the ally always means containing somebody  else and treating somebody as potential enemies, and so on and so forth.  The solidarity is based on the recognition of difference, the difference between political  systems, difference between ideologies, difference between religions and cultures, and the  difference between social structures. Nevertheless, no matter how different each country is,  they can coexist and they can shape a certain kind of solidarity. So in this sense, the recognition  of difference is the precondition for the more equitable relations. And also the solidarity is  shaped for the purpose against the domination, monopoly, hegemony, imperialism, colonialism  and so on and so forth.  
So in that sense, this kind of solidarity means inclusive, more equitable and mutual recognition  and coexistence. So that's based on our traditional wisdom, not only Chinese wisdom, but also  the wisdom shared by many countries and different cultures. So I think it's very different from  the current idea, dominated by some Western politicians that talk about allies. We know that is  the challenge, conflicts and contradictions we are facing now.  So when we talk about solidarity, when we talk about the post-Western world order, we are  actually fully aware of how difficult it is, because we continue the social and political struggles  for several centuries. You can argue that. But on the other hand, if you look back to our history,  in these areas where there was kind of a long history, much longer history, you can see these  kinds of traditions. They can coexist. That gives us some hope from our history. Retrieve that  history for the future.  The whole recognition of difference, is for coexistence. It is not only for the different cultures,  but also between the different political systems and between the big state and the small state,  the strong state and the weak state, as well as the social movements for that.  Rohan Hazell:  Global connections and exchanges of culture, ideas, goods and services have been forged in  different waves throughout recorded history. However, recent developments have been largely  controlled by the West, hence the term Westernisation.  The term Westernisation also stems from colonialism and the fact that in a post-colonial world,  the   rules   have   been   written   by   Western   powers,   Europe   and   the   US   in   particular.  De-Westernisation, rather than being a threat to the West, aims to create a more equitable and  exclusive global order and not simply replace one form of centralised power with another. This  means decision-making on the global stage should include participation from different parts of  the world, making it more democratic.  The intention of these and other proposed changes is not anti-Western, but is driven by a desire  to create more equitable global relations, which are fundamental to addressing the collective  challenges we face.

Stakeholder Management: The Secret to Scalable CSO Initiatives

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Gayathri Vasudevan highlighted the importance of effective stakeholder management, emphasising the need for transparency, knowledge sharing and co-creation.Civil society organisations (CSOs) should be transparent with both the successes and failures of any initiative when managing stakeholders, as this fosters a sense of mutual benefit.Not all engagement must be formal, and CSOs should leverage alternative mediums such as social media, alongside formal engagements, to effectively communicate with governments and communities.Stakeholders, be they governments, businesses, or communities, must be involved in the co-creation of outcomes that affect them to ensure their perspectives, needs, and interests are met.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Stakeholder Management: The Secret to Scalable CSO  Initiatives  Host:  The success of any workforce formalisation initiative, whether in providing housing or  education, depends on communication and engagement between the stakeholders involved, be  they governments, businesses, workers or communities. This is especially the case when it  comes to scaling up successful initiatives.  CSOs often act as the intermediary between these stakeholders, and can play a powerful role in  managing engagements between them. But what does that engagement look like in practice?  Coming up, we'll explore this topic with Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO of LabourNet, an  India-based social enterprise which to date, has provided skills training and access to basic  needs for over 1 million people.  Dr. Vasudevan will share some examples of how CSOs can effectively engage with the various  stakeholders involved in a given formalisation initiative, to first ensure its success, and then its  eventual scalability.  Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan:  So one of the things we believed is that we shouldn't wait for perfection. That means as we are  learning, share it. We find that governments are receptive to both failures and successes.  Everybody obviously wants to discuss what worked, but we do believe that sharing what didn't  work and publicising what didn't work is equally important because that's when I think people  do listen and then the engagement becomes a lot more solid. So all engagement doesn't have  to be a formal engagement.  
Today, the medium of conversation has increased so much, right? You have right from your  social media conversational elements to your … And this is … I'm not talking only with the  general public, including the government. Government is a consumer of social media. So how  do you look at social media as a consumer and therefore the local community as a consumer?  So the offline, online communication, sharing of lessons through simple conversations, be they  panels, discussions, bringing them on board, et cetera, are ways that we've seen to be effective  with government also, and even with business, we feel the interaction has to be more in that  direction. Involve them in the co-creation of the outcome that we want to drive. Stakeholder  management is the key, right? Because in any transformational change, somebody loses,  somebody gains. How do you make both parties feel they gained?  For example, if one was to bring transparency on a simple issue, let's take a centre where we do  training, would involve the educational institutions in that area feeling they have not been able  to deliver skills or the school thinking I can't deliver skills.  That's why an external person has been brought in. How do you change that language from you  gained - I lost - I lost - you gained to saying overall we benefit, I think has been the key to our  model. Similarly with work, how do you explain to a company saying you're not out of cash flow  if you pay them monthly. It doesn't affect you, it's actually better for your cash flow. So what are  those conversations– has been very important.  So for us, we've always believed that sharing knowledge early and sharing wins and losses early  with stakeholders allows them to soak it in. Come back with saying, do you want to move  forward, not what are the issues?  Host:  As Dr Vasudevan has shared, maintaining transparency, fostering co-creation and leveraging  new avenues for communication, are just a few of the many practices that CSOs can leverage  when engaging with stakeholders to scale up workforce formalisation.  When stakeholders are transparent, not just with the successes, but also the failures of a  venture, they can move swiftly to address bottlenecks, while doubling down on the most  impactful efforts.  
It also gives stakeholders more ownership, allowing them to be active participants and drive the  creation of the positive outcomes they seek.

What is Progress? Wellbeing versus Growth

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned that traditional metrics for quantifying the progress of sustainable development do not accurately consider the wellbeing of people and ecosystems. Economic growth as the sole measure of sustainable development is an inadequate metric. When taken in isolation, it ignores the remit of sustainable development: improving human and planetary wellbeing. Equitable progress requires that policymakers, businesses, and societies redefine the scope of success to also account for social and environmental factors, alongside economic indicators. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  What is Progress? Wellbeing versus Growth  Elaine Fernandez:  What do progress and prosperity look like to you? For many, economic growth is the main  measure of national development. But our current approach to quantifying progress by, for  example, measuring a country's annual GDP or GDP per capita, fails to tell the   whole story.  After all, if the aim of sustainable development is to increase quality of life for all while  ensuring the health of our natural systems, surely this goes well beyond purely economic  measures.  Now you'll hear from Professor Emeritus of Climate Strategy at the BI Norwegian Business  School, Jorgen Randers, about a new way to measure progress consisting of four components  tied to societal wellbeing. He explains how adopting this metric will allow u s to course - correct  and renew our efforts at sustainable development.  Professor Jorgen Randers:  What is important is to follow other indicators in addition to the ones we are currently  following. We are clearly following GDP. If, in addition, one started following the fraction of  the population that feels that we are on the right track, you simply as k people, do you believe  that you will be better off 5 years in the future than you are now?  If we started systematically asking that question in addition, we would get a very helpful  additional piece of information, because we might be in a situation where GDP and the  income per person is actually going up, and in a situation where emissions are   going up, but  where people's expectation for the future is going down. And my view is that a wellbeing  index should include those things going up and the expectation for the future that I think will  be going down.  One might add inequality, measured inequality as the component. And I believe that what  will happen with the capitalist society and the market orientation that we   currently see   that  we also will see that equality is going down.  So that we have two things going up and two things going down. And the subjective feeling  of wellbeing, I think, is mirrored relatively well. If you combine those four things, even give  them equal weight, that's one way of doing it. In "Earth for All', we   have chosen a very specific  wellbeing index, which involves choosing the relative weighting of these four components,
  which can of course be done in as many ways as there are human beings. We have relied on  an international network called the Wellbeing Alliance who have chosen the indicators and  chosen the relative weight, and we have essentially borrowed their way of doi ng it.  The important point is that if, as we have, you have a model where you can check, you can  just try in the model with different weightings and see whether this changes your forecast of  social collapse. Because the collapse, of course, occurs when the downwa rd trends start to  overwhelm those things that go well, then you start to get wellbeing declining. And once you  have wellbeing declining, as I said, social tensions   rise,   and the governability of society goes  down.  Elaine Fernandez:  A key question to ask when measuring progress is, even if a country is prospering  economically, is that prosperity felt by citizens at the grassroots? Take a country like Brazil for  example, which in 2022 had the 10th largest GDP, according to the Internat ional Monetary  Fund. However, studies by the World Bank found that approximately 31% of Brazilians still  suffer from moderate or severe food insecurity. When taken on its own, GDP merely sheds  light on a small portion of the bigger picture.  But as Professor Randers puts it, accounting for additional factors like emissions, social  inequality, wages, and public expectations for the future reveals the whole picture and  provides a clearer understanding of the quality of life in a given country an d the direction in  which it is heading.

Redesigning Business Models: Decision-Making Trade-offs  

### keyTakeaway
This chapter emphasised the need for decision-making on business models to include considerations of workers' rights, environmental impact, and community dependence, moving beyond shareholder-centric approaches to broader stakeholder engagement.Many businesses lack internal transparency and often rely on superficial audits. There's a need for businesses to introspect and simplify their models based on core principles.Investors must take responsibility for not just initial commitments but also ongoing monitoring and collaboration with businesses and stakeholders.There's a need to transform business school curricula to include principles of corporate responsibility, environmental standards, and workers' rights.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Business Models: Decision - Making Trade - offs  Rohan Hazell :  Businesses   are   increasingly   being   expected   to   take   into   account   a   broad   range   of  stakeholders, including communities and the environment.  How does this impact decision - making at the strategic level? Sharan Burrow, former General  Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation proposes that companies should  examine and even redesign their business models to thrive when faced with ris ing  expectations to create both commercial and social value .  Sharan Burrow:  So, the first thing I would say is look at the business model. If you're not actually looking at  building a business that is inclusive of the interests of workers, and along with of course,  respect for their rights and the planet, the environment in which   you are operating and the  communities that you   are   actually dependent on, then you are already going to be still stuck  in that shareholder versus broader stakeholder model.  Now, people get sceptical about saying, well, we have to shift to a stakeholder model. What  does that mean? Who are the stakeholders? It doesn't matter. Like, we can't get hung up on  trying to define who should be at the table. If people think they should   be at the table because  they're part of a community, they're a member of a trade union, they're a business leader.  The small to medium enterprises have an incredible set of demands they should be making  because the cost down pressures from big business have not only been,   the exploitation,  meant the exploitation of workers, but in on the road to that, the absolute exploitation of the  small business owner because every year they have less and less, you know per demand of  pricing costs to actually run their business and to co ntinue to deliver the profit margin s , to  keep their contracts. That's insane. I mean, it's just insane. And businesses know that.  It's one thing to talk about efficiency. It's another thing to say, are you actually   externalising  exploitation as the basis of your profits? And that's got to end. So, look at the business model.  And I'll just say one other thing, there   is   a lot of good work going on about transparency, but  many, many businesses have failed to internalise it, and they spend billions of dollars  collectively. It used to be more than 80 billion a year in the reporting auditing and reporting
  industry. If a business is running effectively, of course from time to time you want to do checks  and balances, but I can tell you many of those audits are formulaic, they've never talked to a  worker, they've never actually talked to community leaders, the y've not reflected the views  of the small to medium entrepreneur who they, that the company depends on.  We can do better. Simplify it to the set of questions about the nature of the business model  and its foundation. So yes, you want to produce X or you want to provide Y services, but on  what basis? And I can tell you, you can come down to essentially five o r six points that don't  deviate too far from the social protection model, simply are embedded in the ambitions and  the skillset and the production and the investment in the business itself.  But investors are also part of this equation. And if investors don't take responsibility, not just  for engagement, which I think has improved dramatically, but for really tough conditionality  around you know, not just demanding commitments at the beginning   of the investment cycle,  but monitoring, reviewing them, working with the company and indeed its stakeholders over  the investment cycle. Then again, you've got people just turning blind eye, ticking boxes,  putting in shining reports   –   that's not helping u s.  Exactly. And ESG has to be at the heart of it. Here you come back to the role of government.  You know, there's, I don't know the latest number, but it's about a third of US states who've  actually legislated against investors using ESG principles as a basis   for determining their  investment   decisions. That's, it defies logic. Yes, it just defies logic. It's somehow in the realm  of evil.  But again, it's on the same scale as climate denial. It's on the same scale as labour exploitation  and those dehumanising supply chains. We have to come to terms with, how do you run  businesses,   and you can, and you can make money off the principles of people and planet and  our common security.  Well, I think what you're doing is incredible, and I can't wait to see the whole of the curriculum  because if there's one thing we have to do, and this is championed by the B Team, by the  Earth Day people, by a whole range of activists, we have to change t he business school model.  And it's not about saying everything that went before is bad or you throw it all out. It is about  saying, how do we frame a world of business and profit, with the responsibility of corporate  taxation, of rights for workers, of environmental standards? How   do we actually frame that,  that future, that means that everybody wins from a model of economic wellbeing that is  inclusive, it's distributed on a different basis.  And we are not talking about, you know, being anti - wealth. Like, I don't mind to be honest, if  people are wealthy, although I do not know how you could create nine new billionaires in the  US alone during Covid, for goodness sake, when economies were shut d own. I mean, the level  of Oxfam's report on the growth in billionaires is kind of disgusting really at its heart.
  But it's not about individuals having wealth. It is about people having the dignity of decent  work where you have wages on which you can live with dignity, where your productivity can  be shared through wage growth, where you can build a future on developin g your skills.  So, I would say to young entrepreneurs, think about the value set you share and bring it to  the business model you design. And keep asking questions to see that you don't lose that,  that you don't lose   a sense of understanding of your workforce, of the impact of your carbon  footprint or other environmental use of resources, or destruction of biodiversity or whatever  it might be. Know what your business impact is, know what your footprint is, know your  p eople and keep asking questions as a learner to make sure that that value set that you  brought to the ambition of building business or indeed reforming business is not lost in the  day - to - day world of the cut and thrust of profit generation and supply chain , competition and  the footprint of transport, logistics, and so on.  It really is about being conscious that the business model has to actually be founded on a set  of values that we would want for ourselves, for our children, for our communities. I could  actually talk for days about very good people in their community, peop le who give to the  community, people who give their time, who give resources. But when they walk through the  doors of their business, they leave all that behind. Their churches don't matter, their  communities don't matter. And they play in this, you know,   exploitative model of business. It  doesn't have to be like that.  Rohan Hazell:  Businesses need to adopt a stakeholder - centric model that considers the interests of workers,  communities, and the environment.  Investors must take responsibility for monitoring and reviewing their investments, using ESG  principles as a basis for investment decisions, and engaging actively with companies and their  stakeholders throughout the investment cycle to drive positive chang e.  This requires a mindset shift away from business - as - usual toward models that are inclusive  and distributive in nature.  All stakeholders, from policy makers to business leaders and employees, must be conscious  of the impact of their regulations, business models, and economic activities on the  environment and society, and to adopt strategies that prioritise wellbeing for all .

  TRANSCRIPT  HappyTap: Human - Centred   Innovation for Public Health  Elaine Fernandez:  This case study explores two business challenges through the lens of HappyTap, a social  enterprise that began in Vietnam, and developed the world's first purpose built, low - cost  commercial hand washing device. HappyTap was created by employing a "human - cen tred"  design approach in collaboration with the World Bank and global design company IDEO.  Their device targets a specific social need: personal hygiene, by   promoting handwashing with  soap among children, families   and other key segments of society. It is positioned as an  aspirational household product and a behavioural change tool to reduce diarrheal and  contagious diseases, which is especially relevant in lower - income countries.  It is a great example of redesigning society by putting equal emphasis on creating social and  commercial value. In this case study, we'll focus on four key aspects. First, we'll examine the  social and economic benefits of promoting hygiene to improve publi c health. Second, we'll  explore the business challenge of marketing and selling products that require behavioural  change from consumers. Third, we'll analyse the business solution HappyTap employed to  bring their product to market. And lastly, we'll delve   into the social impact of innovations in  public health.  Let's begin by understanding the social need. According to UNICEF, only three out of five  people in the world have access to basic handwashing facilities. This lack of access affects  billions of individuals in nearly half of all schools in lower - income cou ntries, compromising  the health and well - being of 900 million students.  To make matters worse, only half of healthcare facilities globally have basic hygiene services,  which is a major risk factor for the spread of disease. Improved hygiene and sanitation is an  effective investment in public health. The United Nations estimate s that every dollar spent  on hygiene and sanitation returns nine dollars through lower health costs and greater  productivity.  There is a simple and straightforward method to improve hygiene, which can be done in any  setting and level of development: handwashing with soap. Many international health  institutions, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have emphasised proper  h andwashing as an important element in any public health programme.
  Handwashing is inexpensive, requiring only a source of clean water and access to soap, and  has had a positive impact on reducing disease and infection transmission. However, there  remains a significant gap between awareness and consistent behaviour. While   most people  are aware of the importance of handwashing, an estimated 81% of people worldwide aren't  cleaning their hands regularly because they find it inconvenient or unpleasant.  Sinks need to be satisfying to use and conveniently located. Fundamentally, this is a problem  of   behavioural   change:   how   to   encourage   widespread   adoption   of   regular,   proper  handwashing   ––   a problem common to both developed and developing countries alike.  Now, let's explore the business challenges HappyTap addressed. Their   low - cost   handwashing  device aims to facilitate positive habit formation for those with poor or no access to indoor  plumbing. This was based on the recognition that an enabling environment of all the  necessary elements for handwashing   ––   water, soap, wash basin   ––   at the right places and  times throughout the day was a critical success factor for achieving optimal health outcomes.  There are two key challenges to achieving those outcomes: how to design and sell products  to low - income consumers, who by definition have limited spending power? And how to  generate consumer demand for a new product category, which would require consumers   to  change their behaviours? These challenges are central to the global movement to redesign  society   –   we must find ways of balancing social, environmental, and commercial value  creation through innovative business models, products and services that address   complex  societal needs.  Low - income consumers are understandably more discerning with how they spend what little  disposable income they have. This also means they may be less likely to take a risk on an  untried or untested product   –   this was HappyTap's first business challenge. Gi ven this,  HappyTap refined its business model to focus on both growth and social impact, with a  mission to provide robust, accessible handwashing facilities to 10 million people by 2024.  This also applies to the institutional segment   –   both schools and healthcare facilities. From a  production standpoint, one solution was to leverage local manufacturers and warehouses to  reduce production and distribution costs. This helped make the product   more affordable for  low - income customers.  However, previous attempts by HappyTap to target low - income populations for handwashing  had failed, because most consumers did not immediately see the benefits. HappyTap was  unable to displace cheaper options, like a bucket and ladle, or not washing hands   at all.  HappyTap realised it had to innovate its business model to tailor, bundle, and market its  product effectively.
  One way HappyTap achieved this was by positioning their product based on aspirations,  targeting Vietnam's upwardly mobile population. Aspirational products are lifestyle or status  symbols. that individuals strive for, often beyond their current means. Aspi rational products  have a strong emotional appeal and are typically associated with higher levels of comfort and  prosperity.  In HappyTap's case, this meant associating the product with life success and modernity to  encourage low - income communities to purchase the product. HappyTap realised that pricing  the product properly was tantamount to its success. If the product was too ch eap or overly  subsidised by development organisations, customers would be likely to undervalue or  underutilise the product. So, the product was designed to be of high quality. And priced at   –  rather than below   –   market value.  Once HappyTap had determined the positioning of its product as aspirational, it had to tackle  the next challenge: how to create widespread demand by changing the behaviours of  communities that didn't appreciate the value and benefits of handwashing. When i t comes to  consumer behaviour, awareness is not the same as action.  The knowledge that handwashing helps prevent the spread of infection and disease is  widespread, yet actual rates of practice remain stubbornly low. Nonetheless, creating an  enabling environment is crucial. For establishing regular habits that improve publi c health. As  a result, HappyTap   forged relationships with distribution channels that would help create  demand and promote behaviour change on the company's behalf.  There were three such channels they focused on: First, standard distribution partners, like  retail outlets. Second, channel service partners, who would offer the handwashing device  alongside their own services or products for discounted rates to encourage   customers to buy  "bundles", which leverages the principle that the value of the whole is greater than the sum  of its parts.  One such channel partner was health insurance providers. Third, institutional clients, namely  public and private entities or agencies who could purchase the handwashing devices in bulk  for use in hospitals, schools, workplaces and clinics. These clients wo uld also support the  education of communities on the importance of handwashing.  Finally, customisation options were made available for channel partners, allowing them to  align the device with their branding. Different versions of the device can target specific  population segments or industries. By working with these different partners   and tweaking the  product design for each channel, HappyTap was able to reach different segments of Vietnam's  low - income   communities,   which   created   significant   demand   for   the   product.
  Since 2020, HappyTap has expanded its operations to include India, East Africa, Indonesia,  and the Philippines, in addition to its existing presence in Vietnam, Cambodia, and  Bangladesh. as well as global export markets. Amidst the COVID 19 pandemic, the c ompany  played a vital role in supplying essential equipment to healthcare facilities spanning from  Bangladesh to Papua New Guinea.  Additionally, HappyTap partnered with UNICEF to install sinks, allowing thousands of  preschools in Cambodia to safely resume their operations post pandemic. HappyTap has also  migrated from lower to higher income countries, with successful trials in schools   in the UK,  where it significantly reduced waiting times for children to wash their hands during lunch and  breaks.  In summary, HappyTap's   approach highlights the gap between awareness and action in  consumer behaviour and how important it is to leverage diverse channels and partners to  generate demand for new products and services. Contrary to the conventional approach, the  company's success   has also translated from low to high income markets.  The lessons from HappyTap's business model can be applied for enterprises that do not have  the same resources available to large corporations. It also has relevance for large corporate  ventures seeking to redesign their business models for lower - income con sumers, particularly  those involved in meeting basic needs like clean water, sanitation, healthcare and education.  Importantly, HappyTap's success demonstrates the feasibility of creating both commercial  and social value, a necessity for business models that can ultimately contribute to redesigning  society in the 21st century.

Living Systems: Lessons from Nature

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about how incorporating a Living Systems Approach in all aspects of human design can contribute to creating more sustainable and resilient societies.Embracing a Living Systems Approach enables the design and building of sustainable solutions, systems, and institutions, improving existing development efforts while creating new modes of development - including a better-managed environment.Accounting for equitable and accessible distribution of resources like education and healthcare in urban development will foster healthy and dignified living conditions for all residents.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Living Systems: Lessons from Nature  Rohan Hazell :  When viewed in totality, our approaches to sustainable development aren't actually all that  sustainable. Take the growing transition to green energy systems, which is a sorely needed  transformation. This transition also means we need more batteries, which   then drives up  demand for rare earth minerals like cobalt, which are mined by workers in   low - income  countries like the Democratic Republic of   Congo , often in dangerous and inhumane  conditions.  Clearly, sustainable development initiatives can be guided by the right intentions. But without  critical thinking, empathy and purposeful stakeholder engagement, it's possible to overlook  adverse impacts on people or the planet. To address this, we speak t o Dr. Mamphela  Ramphele, former Managing Director of the World Bank, about a living systems approach.  She will explain how learning from and emulating nature's interconnected systems can make  our development efforts more sustainable.  Dr. Mamphela Ramphele:  A living systems approach is an approach that learns from nature. When you look at whether  they are ants or you look at plants, they operate as an interlinked, interdependent system.  Unfortunately, the way we have thought about development has been linear.   We look at  education, separate the economy, health care, infrastructure. Whereas if you look at ants,  they don't have any of that. It's all part and parcel of one thing. An ant heap is a whole city  with all the plumbing, railroads, everything.  And so what this living systems approach reminds us of is that we are part of nature. We have  to learn from nature. And when you do it that way, everything adds on. So, you get positive  feedback loops, you get reinforcing benefits.  And so again, back to my own country that ad we, for example in 1994, not taken the kind of  siloed approach, but taken the comprehensive redevelopment of the country, we would have  been able to look at building human settlement, transforming apartheid citi es where the  elites are at the centre, where all the major benefits of a city are the infrastructure, is the  resources, cultural, economic and others. When you build in a living systems approach, you  make sure that you create like the way you would approac h creating a village ecosystem.  Ecovillage. And even a big city like Cape Town, you can turn it into an ecovillage by looking at  how do you make sure that those who need most support are closest to the resources for  that support? And it doesn't have to be   one big conglomerate, but you can create healthy
  sizes of community that then work together with appropriate schools, sporting facilities and  other cultural facilities.  Rohan Hazell:  Understandably, maintaining a big picture or systems view when pursuing sustainable  development is a daunting task. After all, how can we possibly account for all the moving  pieces on the board? If we're talking about redesigning a city like Hanoi, Paris o r Johannesburg  for example. Luckily, as Dr. Ramphele has shared, we don't have to reinvent the wheel here.  With a living systems approach, it is possible to learn from nature, which manages to keep  vast ecosystems of distinct yet interconnected parts and stakeholders all in equilibrium. By  taking on board some of these lessons, like accounting for access to res ources in our urban  planning, we can start to design more equitable systems, institutions and cities, all of which  are a core component of sustainable development. Whether it's the way we build our cities,  distribute resources or consume energy, human citi es, distribute resources or consume  energy, human development is still far from sustainable.  Human designs tend to create systems and institutions that function well in   isolation but   fall  short as integrated parts of a broader developmental approach. This has created many  unintended consequences, from wastage of resources to unequal access and poor living  conditions for many. So how can we start to approach development more sustainabl y? Dr.  Ramphele shares her insights.  Dr. Mamphela Ramphele:  I have the benefit of having grown up in a village where my ancestors and they were not  unique, but that's how it is. If you go to most indigenous communities, they build human  settlements in harmony with the nature around them. So we grew up with rondavel s made  from adobe, and thatch roof. So, you use material that is organic and that is abundant in the  particular area, so you don't damage the balance in the ecosystem. But also, there was  integration in the village I grew up in, in the sense of every famil y had its own living quarters,  but there was no such thing as being lonely because you were families within an extended  family within a village.  Now, look at our cities today, whether it's Cape Town or New York, or Bangladesh, or  Singapore, wherever. We have been very negligent in constructing buildings, both for human  occupation and for industrial use, without giving enough thoughts to regenerativ e building  approaches the built environment, that should be reimagined in line with the wisdom of  nature. In that approach, one would imagine that we build with not just the materials, and  there were lots of examples of natural materials that we can build.   And so the issue of energy  is tied to how we construct human settlement and settlements or spaces where we work. The
  wisdom of nature is that where one lives,where one plays, where one gets educated or learns,  and where one works, we're all integrated.  Now, you look at the city of Cape Town. People who are working in the city live something  like 20 kilometres from here. That is inefficient from an energy point of view, from a human  wellbeing point of view. And so the focus on the energy transition should   not only be about,  let's get more renewable, let's look at our relationship energy, which is tied to our reimagined  the need for us to reimagine our built environment so that we have more energy efficient,  less use of energy. There's no need for every fam ily to have a car if you have an efficient,  effective public transport system. But most African cities, and I think cities in most of the  world are highly inefficient and so pollution is going to remain a problem. Whatever we say  about zero carbon, for as   long as we don't have effective public transport system, using trams,  using all of the things, or even bicycles and other low - tech solutions, we are not going to solve  the problem.  And so energy is a major enabler, but we have to redefine what is enough energy and how do  we make sure that the renewable energy sources that we are building all over the world are  utilised in a way that is sustainable? If we continue at the rate we are u sing energy, we are  not going to be able to create enough of it for our wellbeing.  Rohan Hazell:  As Dr. Ramphele has shared, by looking at our societies through the living systems lens, we  can begin to identify disconnections and opportunities for redesign. For example, can our  infrastructure be built with local materials, instead of environmentally d egrading imported  alternatives? Or can our settlements be designed to be less fragmented, so that our  transitions between living, working and recreation become more seamless?  Taking cues from nature in creating designs that cater to society and strengthen the  ecosystem as a whole can inspire governments and businesses to contribute in new and  exciting ways to sustainable development.

Political Meritocracy in the Global Context

### keyTakeaway
This chapter emphasised the distinctiveness of political meritocracy within the Chinese context, acknowledging its inapplicability for export to countries with differing political cultures, sizes, or historical experiences. China's political meritocracy is tailored to its own context, influenced by its dominant political culture, size, reform history, and public support. This system, which might work in China, is unlikely to be effective or desired in countries with different political cultures or smaller sizes. In liberal democracies, the assumption is that all political leaders, regardless of their expertise, should be elected. This approach can lead to the selection of leaders who might not align with expert opinions, making it difficult to implement policies based on performance metrics. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Political Meritocracy in the Global Context  Elaine Fernandez:  The culture of China plays a large role in how effective its system of political meritocracy is. From  its population and geographical size to its historical political culture and economic trajectory,  China’s political ideals are uniquely its own.  For this reason, Professor Daniel Bell, Chair of Political Theory at the University of Hong Kong  Faculty of Law, suggests that China’s system may not be applicable to other nations. Importantly,  he argues that China has little interest in exporting its pol itical system abroad.  Professor Daniel Bell:  I do want to emphasise that the political meritocracy is quite distinctive to the Chinese context.  That's why, unlike the US, which always wants to promote its political system abroad, China has  no interest. I mean, China is well aware that it's because of   its dominant political culture, because  of the size of the country, because of the process of reform over the past few decades, because  of the people's support for meritocracy.  It might work in a Chinese context, but it's not likely to work in contexts that do not have the  same kind of political culture or that are smaller in size, or where the people have different views  about what's the appropriate kind of public officials or t hat don't have this experience of political  reform. So, I mean, other countries, like perhaps Singapore, you know, which perhaps not  coincidentally, have a strong kind of Confucian/Chinese heritage, also pride themselves to a  certain extent on their politi cal meritocracy.  But other countries maybe   can,   and I think should learn from aspects of the Chinese political  system. But the idea that it could be taken as a whole and exported is really a misguided, perhaps  even a dangerous idea. I think it's very important for that to be clear. I'm not denying that   there  are universal human rights. I mean, China too, at least at the level of public endorsement,  endorses basic human rights. You shouldn't kill innocent people. Torture is bad, slavery is bad,
  genocide is bad. We should provide basic material needs for the people, right to food, decent  healthcare and so on.  There's no argument, at least at the level of principle, about those basic human rights, whether  it's China or the US or Canada or many other countries. But when it comes to the right way of  selecting public officials, I do think China has its own system a nd has no desire and no ability  anyway to promote its political ideals abroad. And this way, honestly speaking, I don't understand  why there's so much worry, for example, in the West about China exporting its political system.  It's just not going to happen. There's no desire for China to do so. It's really about China improving  its own political meritocracy to work harder to ensure that there are creative and talented public  officials with the motivation to serve the political c ommunity, while allowing for substantial  democratic practices at lower levels of government. There's still a gap. There's always going to  be a gap between the ideal and the reality, but it's a question of how to reduce that gap. And  again, it's not about a   perfect system or guaranteeing an ideal. No, it's about increasing the  advantages and reducing the disadvantages.  There's an assumption in liberal democracy that regardless of the levels of government, all  political leaders will be selected by, or elected by means of elections. So it doesn't matter what  the path of the leaders are. I mean, so long as they're endorsed   by the people, they can choose  leaders who do things that wouldn't necessarily be endorsed by scientists and experts. So it's  very hard to have a performance matrix for politicians in countries that use elections at all levels  of government.  If there is a country like China, which has a long history of political meritocracy, and where there's  great respect for leaders who are viewed to have ability as well as to have virtue, then it's easier  to implement policies that promote social responsibi lity and serve the common good. In highly  individualistic political cultures, it would be much more difficult. So that's one reason why, again,  I don't think China has any interest in promoting its political model, because it builds on the  mainstream polit ical culture.  But there are thinkers who argue that in some countries you can have, for example, even think  of the UK with the House of Lords. With the House of Lords, I mean, originally it was composed  of those who were selected because of their aristocratic heritage,   or it was a kind of birthright.  But more and more it became a kind of more meritocratic institution where you were selected  partly because of your members of a political party, sometimes partly because of the excellent  performances that you did in society,   which I think is a good thing in principle.
  But again, ironically, the more it became meritocratic, the more the House of Lords began to be  seen as illegitimate because it was viewed as undemocratic. Now, if there's a bit more openness  on the minds of opinion leaders, and as well as the people in ge neral, about the need for more  informed deliberation, long term thinking, at least in an advisory capacity, in an institution like  the House of Lords that would be meritocratically selected, then it's possible to have that  adaptation. In liberal democracie s, even though things are all going the wrong way now, in liberal  democracies, there's much more populism and less respect for, let's just say, meritocratically  selected officials.  Elaine Fernandez:  Professor Bell emphasises that China’s political meritocracy isn’t easily transferable to other  countries. Because of this, he believes China has no interest in exporting its system of  governance, especially to countries with more individualistic political   cultures.  Nevertheless, there are features of the Chinese system that may be beneficial to other countries,  particularly the emphasis on long - term vision and planning.

What is Insured Resilience and Why Do We Need It?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we highlighted the importance of proactive, collective, and preventive measures to ensure resilient societies in the face of existential threats.Insured Resilience aims to secure and protect the collective good by building societies capable of withstanding and recovering from shocks like climate change, water scarcity, pandemics, and food security challenges. It focuses on prevention and protection against crises rather than just response.Four key components underlie Insured Resilience:Effective public policy, balancing long-term societal needs with individual rights and freedoms.New business models to internalise costs generated by producers, such as accounting for CO2 emissions.Rethinking social organisation at community, national, and international levels to prioritise collective welfare and shape the social contract.Unleashing the potential of organisations and individuals to drive the transformations needed to redesign society.Part of unleashing your potential involves igniting or reigniting a sense of purpose to understand how the components of Insured Resilience relate to your personal and professional life.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  What is Insured Resilience and Why Do We Need It?  Rohan Hazell:  In the previous module, we were rethinking the economic governance and societal systems that  shape our world. Now we'll look at how to make the systemic transformations we need into a  reality through the final component of redesigning society. Insured resilience.  To introduce this concept, you'll hear from GIFT.ed chairman, Chandran Nair.  Chandran Nair:  Redefining progress in our age means not simply thinking about prosperity from the point of  view of material acquisitions and convenience, but essentially the collective issue of how do  societies remain resilient. In the light of all that we know about the threats that we face, how do  we use the advanced knowledge and the science and the technologies that we have to protect  societies from what is very clear will be challenging times going forward in a crowded planet.  So, resilient societies, and I like to use the term moving from the industrial revolution 4.0, which  is the term that's used to define our age today, which is the digital age, that everything is  connected in the Internet of Things, big data, and moving from that notion of progress, that the  industrial revolution to what I call IR 1.0.  So what is ensured resilience? IR 1.0? The fundamental basis of that thought is to suggest that  rather than relying on technology as a cure all, ensure that civilizations have the resilience to  sustain prosperity for all. So let's take a closer look at what we mean by this. The word insured  means to secure or protect someone against a possible contingency.  What are those contingencies in our era? We've already started to talk about this. In this case,  the economic, social, and climate trends we face in the 21st century. We've already seen that in  many countries, the old approaches to economic prosperity are no longer possible.  Then there is the question of what do we mean by the word resilience? Resilience means  different things to many people and is used extremely widely, particularly these days in  
developing circles, but it should denote a society's ability to withstand and recover from the  shocks when they occur. That's really what resilience should mean.  We found out that during the pandemic, many societies had no resilience at all built into the  system, rich and poor countries. Over two and a half years, we found out that now we've built  some of that resilience. Some of that resilience comes in the forms of a vaccine. But other forms  of resilience are being built in.  As governments have responded to the pandemic and understood that basic health care and  ways of allowing people access to those facilities are very important, but also to now look at  essentially what are the factors that made some people succumb more easily than others. So  building that resilience into society is fundamental as we enter this era of existential threats.  Together, Insured Resilience frames a society that is designed to both prevent and protect, not  just respond, but to prevent and protect against crisis. And that's the kind of redesign we all  need to think about.  Rohan Hazell:  Insured Resilience is the measure of our ability to anticipate and mitigate existential threats. It  includes everything from improving food security to implementing renewable energy solutions,  developing effective water supply and sanitation, and creating products and services for a  circular economy.  What unites these different efforts are four key components: public policy, business model  innovation, social organisation, and unleashing the potential of organisations and individuals.  First, effective public policy will better balance the long term needs of society. with respect for  individual rights and freedoms.  Second, new business models are needed to end the externalisation of costs that are generated  by producers, but carried by the environment and society as a whole. Accounting for CO2  emissions, as we're beginning to see, is just the tip of the iceberg. Third, rethinking social  organisation at the community, national and international levels so that collective welfare  shapes the social contract and even international relations.  Last, unleashing the potential of organisations and people is vital given they are the building  blocks of our global economic governance and societal systems. Unleashing their potential will  
eventually lead to a tipping point and enable the transformations we need to redesign society.  As you continue your GIFT.ed learning journey, you'll get a deep understanding of how these  four aspects of ensured resilience interface with one another, and how they relate to you and  your work.  For now, we'll conclude this module with a look at a core element of unleashing potential,  which is igniting or reigniting a sense of purpose.

Introduction to Externalities

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you were introduced to the concept of externalities, which are the hidden costs or benefits of economic activity that create challenges for individuals, society, and the environment.Externalities are considered a “market failure” that occurs when economic activities have unintended consequences on third parties that aren't reflected in the prices we pay for goods or services. The true impacts of externalities are far-reaching, hard to quantify and can inflict major harm on society, the environment, and the economy if mismanaged.Beneficiaries of the market system reap the gains of economic activity without bearing the costs of its externalities, which often are hidden and unaccounted for.The concept of externalities was first developed and formalised by British economist Arthur Pigou over a century ago.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Introduction to Externalities  Elaine Fernandez:  Externalities are one of the biggest challenges we must address and overcome in order to  Redesign Society. They are one of the most important unanswered and, unfortunately, often  overlooked questions of the current economic model that the world has embraced.  In fact, they are so important that seeking to mitigate the effects of negative externalities is also  one of the main reasons that governments around the world intervene in economic activity. It is  also a major source of tension between business and regulators.  We will explore some fundamental questions around externalities: What are they? How are  they   created?   Why   are   they   often   consistently   ignored? How are they woven into our  consumption-driven economic model? What impact do they have on society, the economy, and  the environment?  And crucially: What can we do to offset their negative consequences, rebuild the social contract  to be inclusive of externalities, and redesign society to address their adverse impacts?  Dealing with externalities has wide-ranging implications from assumptions about what we can  consume and how much, what rights do businesses have with regard to imposing externalities  on societies, how we live, the price of goods and services, and the role of the state.  In this module, we’ll first explore the four categories of externalities, share real-world examples  of each, and learn why, at this point in history, we can’t delay confronting this challenge any  longer.  Rohan Hazell:  What are externalities anyway?  Simply put, they are a feature of “market failure”, which is a situation that arises when  economic activity produces suboptimal results and even unintended consequences on wider  society.  
Externalities occur when the effects of production and/or consumption of goods and services  impose financial costs (or in some cases benefits) onto a third party which are not reflected in  the prices charged for those goods or services.  Now that might be a bit of a tongue twister, but you don’t need an economics degree to fully  comprehend externalities.  In practical terms, we all experience them first-hand every day of our lives, so they are quite  easy to understand, though their consequences are often complex and, when mismanaged,  negative externalities can be very damaging to society, the environment and the economy itself.  While externalities have existed since the earliest forms of trade began, the concept was  developed and formalised just over one hundred years ago by British economist Arthur Pigou.  There is a clue in the name “externality”, as the effects they cause are always external to the  beneficiaries of the market system and are often concealed and not paid for through any formal  economic transaction.  Elaine Fernandez:  In summary, externalities are a critical shortfall in our economic model that need addressing to  create a sustainable future.  They represent market failures where the effects of economic activities impose costs or benefits  on third parties, not reflected in market prices.  These often overlooked consequences prompt government intervention and can cause tension  between businesses and regulators.

Redesigning Society: The Embedded Economy

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Kate Raworth emphasised reimagining the economy as a diverse, interconnected system that is part of society and the living world. This new economic vision challenges traditional concepts like market centrality. The economy should be seen as a subset of human society and the Earth's biosphere, necessitating systems that are compatible with the planet's ecological limits and human welfare. The economy comprises more than just the market and state; it includes households and the commons, where unpaid work and shared resources are fundamental yet often overlooked. People's economic roles are diverse, extending beyond being mere consumers to encompass various social, communal, and environmental stewardships, each contributing to a healthy, multifaceted economy.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Society: The Embedded Economy  Rohan Hazell:  According to Oxford economist Kate Raworth, the economy, reliant on the Earth's resources,  must operate within ecological limits, adhering to principles of sustainability and circularity.   She  proposes that the economy is a social invention, embedded within human society, which in turn  is a part of the Earth's biosphere.  This   is   known   as   the   Embedded   Economy,   which   moves   beyond   traditional   economic  understandings   to   recognises   the   interconnectedness   of   market,   state,   household,   and  commons.  Kate Raworth:  If we want to create a world that lives in the Doughnut, that's our goal, what would we create as  the first system map of the economy? I believe it should not be supply and demand of the market.  It should be this diagram. I call it the embedded economy dia gram. What's going on here?  First, crucially, we recognise that the economy is a subsystem of human society. It's a social  invention. We created it and we can recreate it. And human society is a subsystem of the rest of  the living world. So, the economy is a subset of earth and the b iosphere, and therefore must be  compatible with life on Earth. And as you can see, there's solar energy. We are hit by a stream of  energy every day from the sun that comes in, and we must be genius and capture the sun's energy  and transform it into energy   that we can use in life.  We are drawing in everyday materials and matter from earth into the economy, and we are  putting out waste and pollution. So, the 101 of ecological economics says the economy cannot  draw in any more energy matter than the Earth can create and should not put   out any more  waste than the Earth can assimilate. These are very clear guidelines for the stream of materials  that flow through the economy. That's why we need circularity.
  So, let's zoom in. The economy is not just the market, where we show up either as consumer or  producer, and in the space of producer, it really matters whether you are labourer, earning a  wage, or you are a capital owner earning the rents and the returns o f profit.  But we are not just consumers and producers. That would have us nearly shopping and working  and shopping and working and shopping and working. We are not consumers. We are full,  rounded people. We are also in relation to the state, public servants, doctors , and nurses. We  are residents of a place, whether citizens or not. We are residents, we are voters, we are  protestors. All of these are important roles that we play in our relationship to ensuring that the  state provides the public goods that are essentia l in our lives, that the market cannot hope to  provide like healthcare for all, education for all, roads, vaccines. We need investment in public  goods.  Now, these two, the market and the state, they got locked into a 20th century battle, I'd say an  ideological battle. Are you a laissez - faire free market capitalist or are you a state loving socialist?  It's such a boring, out of date battle. We need both, I   believe, the market and the state. But in  their battling, they completely ignored two other fundamental sources of our wellbeing and, and  they only measure GDP along this horizontal, right? GDP measures what's sold in the market,  what's produced by the st ate.  It completely ignores what's happening here on the vertical. We are also members of households.  Every day, we begin our day as a parent, a partner, a relative, a child. We are drawn in unpaid,  caring work, the work of love, sometimes the work of gritted te eth. It's the cooking, washing,  cleaning, sweeping, raising the kids, doing it all again tomorrow. This is what gets labour fresh  and ready for work in the market every day. And if it's ignored, we completely ignore this  enormous contribution, predominantl y from women historically, around the world. We must  make it visible because it's essential for life, it's essential for our wellbeing if it's ignored, exploited  and overstretched.  And we must recognise we are commoners. We volunteer, we share, we co - create. We steward  shared resources, whether it's our culture and our songs and our myths, whether it's, uh,  Wikipedia on the Worldwide Web, whether it's a neighbourhood garden on the co rner of our  block. We must protect the commons and the household. These spaces do not depend upon  money changing hands, but they create so much value and they're essential to the operation of  the whole economy.
  And I believe that Covid was actually a really important experience, making it possible for us to  see these other parts of the economy more clearly. Because when the market space got shut  down, the physical market space got shut down. Of course, the online   market space boomed and  some people became ultra - billionaires as a result. But the physical spaces were   closed   due to the  need for physical distancing.  And then the state had to step in and step up in many countries, paying workers’ wages, but also  frontline workers, health workers, people replenishing essential services and shops. And  [01:00:00] everybody started asking whose work is essential work and w hy are they paid so little?  Households had to step in and step up, caring for the sick, home - schooling children, huge times  of stress. Some people found joy in this lockdown. Other people found real stress and there was  a great increase in domestic violenc e. Again, the strains of the economy coming into the  household.  And the commons. People turned to the commons. They made WhatsApp groups for their street  checking in on each other. In my own street here in the UK, we became a community for the first  time, thanks to a WhatsApp group created by the Covid crisis. We becam e a community of care.  Soup kitchens, food kitchens, food banks, looking after each other. And the one thing that people  have said they don't want to lose post - Covid crisis is this bigger sense of “we”.  We are not   “ Rational Economic Man ” . We are social humans. We are depending upon each other.  We thrive when we need   each other and can help each other.  So, let that be at the heart of a 21st century portrait and let this richer vision of these many forms  of economics and our many roles be visible every day. Because each one of us weaves them all  together every day. We rarely name them, but don't let anyon e tell us we're consumers.  I'm a parent. I'm a child. I   am   a shopper. I   am   a worker. I   am   a protester. I   am   a voter. I   am   a  resident. I   am   a commoner. I   am   a steward. And I   am   all of these things every day. And I want to  be trained in and spoken to in the values and the behaviours and the culture that enables me to  thrive in all of these spaces because I believe a healthy economy requires all of them.  Rohan Hazell:  The economy is embedded in our societies, so to be a force for real transformation it must be  designed with societal and planetary needs in mind.
  It is our collective responsibility to be more than just “consumers”. An economy that serves its  true purpose requires us to actively participate in shaping it, rather than allowing market forces  or vested interests to determine our future.  Redesigning our economies is a fundamental part of redesigning society, and we can all play a  part   -   whether in our communities, businesses, cities, or countries   -   to design economic  approaches that will enable us to live and thrive within the Doughnut.

Responding to Climate Change: Adaptation

### keyTakeaway
Adapting to climate change is crucial for safeguarding at-risk freshwater resources.Protecting watersheds and forests, using urban planning for rainwater catchment, and enhancing groundwater recharge are a few smart urban and agricultural practices being deployed currently.Utilising technology like geographic information systems (GIS) for monitoring and planning can significantly enhance water management and conservation efforts in response to climate variability.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Responding to Climate Change: Adaptation  Olivia Lai:   Given that freshwater availability globally is also under extreme stress as a result  of climate change, then adaptation strategies are needed to improve the resilience of  freshwater systems. This will ensure that people and organisations can sustainably u se water  for their needs.  It all starts with the protection of watersheds and forests. Keeping ecosystems intact will  increase the storage capacity of freshwater systems and will help alleviate the impacts of  drought by allowing water to be stored during wet periods and used during   dry periods. Urban  planning is important here where rainwater catchment units can be strategically placed to  help communities with domestic water use.  Other methods include constructing new reservoirs, expanding existing reservoirs, and  implementing groundwater recharge programs. Groundwater is the water stored in soil and  rock and comprises around 30% of all readily available freshwater in the world. So , it is  important to allow it to recharge naturally by periodically limiting water extraction and pricing  extraction properly.  As with addressing pollution in freshwater sources, it is equally important to consider the vital  role played by ecosystems in helping deal with weather fluctuations caused by climate  change. Protecting and restoring ecosystems that have been degraded by h uman activity can  help increase water retention and also prevent soil erosion, which means vegetation can grow  and provide ecosystem services that protect water sources.  Geographic information systems or GIS have been used to map out how rivers and lakes are  changing in the face of shifting weather patterns as well as how ecosystems are able to  protect water sources. Cape Town in South Africa, for example, nearly ran out o f water in  2017. So, it employed a combination of GIS satellite imagery and   real - time   water level  measurements to better understand how river channels and aquifers were changing during  times of drought.  But freshwater adaptation strategies to climate change don't just have to address water  sources, but also deal with industries that use water. For example, in addition to deploying  efficient irrigation methods, developing drought - resistant agricultural pra ctices can help  reduce water demands for agriculture. This can involve developing crop varieties that require  less water, improving irrigation techniques, or using farming approaches that are less at odds  with ecosystems.
  Climate change seems like a distant challenge to most of us. Yet, it can drastically reduce  access to freshwater for communities of all sizes from villages to cities. It is for this reason  that governments, businesses, and civil societies must prepare with   forward - thinking  adaptation strategies now.

Principal Objective 2: Providing the Basic Rights to Life (Part 2)

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Chandran Nair explored the State’s responsibility to provide education, affordable healthcare, and meaningful work.Access to education is a fundamental right, yet it remains unmet for many globally. The privatisation of education has led to a widening divide, making government investment and intervention in public education more crucial than ever.The healthcare sector's privatisation has created disparities, with world-class facilities accessible only to a fraction of the population. It is imperative for governments, especially in developing countries, to ensure healthcare is affordable and accessible to all.Governments have a responsibility to provide meaningful employment opportunities. This involves rethinking traditional economic investments and considering the social and environmental impacts of the labour market.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Principal Objective 2:  Providing the Basic Rights to Life (Part 2)  Elaine Fernandez:  Access to education, affordable healthcare, and meaningful work are three of the basic rights to  life that the government has a role in providing to its citizens.  You’ll hear about these three basic needs and their relationship to the State from Chandran Nair,  Chairman of GIFT.ed.  Chandran Nair:  The fourth one is access to education and literacy for all. I don't need to expand on that too much,  but in many countries of the world that is still something that is not achieved by a great amount  of the population. There are many efforts continuing. But   again, I would argue that more time is  spent trying to build the economy without thinking about how   we fulfil   the education needs. And  what is happening in education today is quite frightening.  Education is a public good and education is something that the governments must invest in  heavily. But over the last 50 years we have seen so much of education become privatised. The  privatised education has therefore meant a rush by those who can afford i t to essentially ensure  that their children have access to that government investing less and a complete distortion of  that.  So your basic rights to life are education and government intervention is essential. Then I don't  need to tell you all that affordable healthcare becomes primary. The privatisation to markets for  healthcare has also distorted things. The economic interests   of players in the healthcare industry  means that there is now a disproportionate amount of money going to healthcare, world class  healthcare facilities, but only accessible to some sets of the population.  We need a way in which healthcare provisions led by the state, ensure that people are not left to  the whims of a market. And governments need to seriously attend to this situation, particularly
  in developing countries, where there are pockets of such concentration of wealth and the ability  of economic actors to serve those needs allows for   growth but   disenfranchises the majority of  the population.  Governments are the only ones who can intervene there, because everyone should have the  basic rights of healthcare. The last basic rights of life to which governments have an obligation is  to provide fulfilling and meaningful work for people who enter the   labour market. And this is  something that needs to be thought through in ways that include, of course, the provision of  markets through the economy, etc.  But the economy is also something in which the governments can shape the way people enter  the workforce. And there are a lot of ideas about how this can be done. But it cannot be simply  governments thinking that the only way that they can create meaningful   work is   by the traditional  ways of economic investments, irrespective of the extreme trade - offs, when the economic actors  also then create social and environmental disruptions.  Elaine Fernandez:  The State has a vital obligation to provide the six basic rights to life.  Many people in high - income countries take these services for granted as they rarely have to think  about how their water, electricity, or transport infrastructure is provided.  In lower - income countries, these services are transformational in breaking the cycle of poverty,  helping people live a life of dignity, and contributing to the development and progress of society.

Global Sustainability Challenges: Part 2

### keyTakeaway
Professor Jeffrey Sachs provided a systemic view of global sustainability challenges, including four key objectives of sustainable development.Four Objectives of Sustainable Development:- Material Sufficiency: Ensuring basic needs are met, with dignity for all.- Social Inclusion and Justice: Creating societies where everyone can find their rightful, dignified place.- Environmental Sustainability: Operating within planetary boundaries to avoid environmental destruction.- Peace: Especially crucial among major global powers.The global economy facilitates resource movement through trade, finance, and technology but fails to ensure material sufficiency and dignified lives for all. It also destroys the environment and even encourages geopolitical conflict.Effective multilateralism is essential. This requires moving beyond nationalism and greed to a cooperative approach, recognising that global sustainability challenges require collective action.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Global Sustainability Challenge s : Part 2  Rohan Hazell:  Dr.   Jane Goodall introduced some of the major sustainability issues the world is facing. Now,  Professor Jeffrey Sachs, world - renowned development economist and President of the UN  Sustainable Development Solutions Network, will share his view on our global su stainability  challenges.  Professor Jeffrey Sachs:  The world is deeply interconnected and facing some very major, even dire, challenges. But  our international institutions and ways of thinking are not in line with our needs. We have a  mindset about our own societies and cultures and place in the world. But   none of this actually  is delivering what the world really needs, which is material sufficiency so that people can  survive and lead decent and dignified lives. Social inclusion and justice, so that people find  their suitable place as dignified members of s ociety within their societies.  An economy that operates within the   so - called   planetary boundaries, meaning that we're not  wrecking the environment as we go about our economic affairs and peace, especially peace  between the major powers of the world.  We're not achieving any of that right now.  We're a rich world with a lot of poverty that remains, which is shocking because we have all  the means, the know - how, the technology, the capital to end poverty. But we choose not to  do it. We're a world that is deeply divided within our societies by wealt h, by class structure,  by educational attainment, by ethnicity, by religion, gender, race, lots of deep divisions and a  lot of social injustice. And we are absolutely, fundamentally endangering the physical systems  that we depend on for growing food, for s afety of daily life, for availability of fresh water, for  being able to escape from devastating storms and sea level rise, floods, droughts and other  visitations that come with the human - made environmental crises.  And to top it all off, we have open war, a proxy war between Russia and the United States  taking place in Ukraine, to the massive destruction of that country. We have incredible  geopolitical tensions, the most in decades between the US and China.
  So of all of these four objectives that I call sustainable development, material sufficiency,  social justice, environmental sustainability and peace, we're off track on all of them. So, we  have to understand that that is really the diagnostic challenge of   the field of sustainable  development in which I have spent my life. It's the practical challenge for businesses,  government, civil society, international organisations to understand why we're off track and  what we need to do.  In a short phrase, nothing about the international economy guarantees the end of poverty or  social justice. This is the first point. Those goals of ending poverty and social inclusion are not  going to be solved by the magic of the marketplace. They're goin g to be solved by deliberate  social and political decision making. And we are not there yet.  Second, there's nothing in the global economic system that automatically protects the  environment. The environment has been a free dumping ground for economic activity  through much of history. We have regulations, but they're often very weak in the face of   big  money, greed, corporate irresponsibility, and the lack of regulation. So we don't have any  guarantee of a safe environment unless we choose a safe environment.  And when it comes to war and peace, we think on the national level rather than on the global  cooperative level. So each country says, what should I do to increase our national power? But  when you add that up, each country ends up exacerbating the internati onal tensions, which  then sometimes spill over into open war.  So   this system needs an overhaul. We have 8 billion people. We have powerful technologies,  but we don't have the mindset or the institutions to achieve sustainable development. The  world has adopted a common set of goals. Several of them, in fact. The Sustai nable  Development Goals, The Paris Climate Agreement, the Kunming - Montreal Biodiversity  Framework, a new High Seas Ocean Treaty. Wonderful goals. But it has not yet adopted the  means to implement those goals. And it has not yet achieved a high enough level   of  understanding of what it will take to achieve the goals.  The mindset remains nationalism. The mindset remains greed. The mindset remains “me  first”, whether it's at the individual level or at the national level. Not that “we're all in this  together.” How can we cooperate to achieve the objectives?  So this is a big deal, because the crises are very significant. They're actually growing in  severity, and we're not dealing with them effectively.  Rohan Hazell:  Professor Sachs has outlined sustainability challenges from a global systemic perspective.  Material sufficiency, social justice, environmental sustainability and peace   are core elements
  of sustainable development. If we continue with business as usual, governments and  companies across the world will not be on track to meet any of these objectives. In fact, the  collective efforts we have taken to become more sustainable have often been mis guided.  These sustainability myths are what we'll explore in the next chapter.

Moving Toward the Doughnut: Differences Between Nations

### keyTakeaway
The transition towards the Doughnut model must be tailored to each country's context, involving leapfrogging past degenerative technologies and embracing distributive and circular practices. Lower and middle-income countries have the opportunity to bypass degenerative technologies, as seen with telecommunications, and embrace distributive and regenerative models like solar energy. The shift from centralised, fossil fuel-based energy systems to distributed renewable energy sources like solar and wind power offers a chance for local ownership and income generation. Many societies, especially in lower-income countries, have maintained circular relationships with local resources, providing valuable lessons for sustainable practices. High-income countries face the challenge of transitioning from established, degenerative systems, such as car-centric cities and fossil fuel dependency, to more sustainable, circular models.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Moving Toward the Doughnut: Differences Between Nations  Rohan Hazell:  Achieving regenerative and distributive economies is the new paradigm set out by Oxford  economist, Kate Raworth.  But how can we get there? This journey, while universal in its goal, varies significantly based on  each nation's unique starting point and resources.  Ms Raworth explores how lower -   and middle - income countries can benefit from leapfrogging,  while higher - income nations need to overcome the challenge of “lock - in.”  Kate Raworth:  Every nation in the world needs to move towards the Doughnut. And I believe every country  needs to put in practice dynamics of becoming regenerative and distributive. And that's going to  look different according to each country's starting point. In some wa ys, lower - income and  middle - income   countries   have   the   chance   of   leapfrogging   past   lock - in   of   degenerative  technologies, as they have already done with smartphones and telecommunications. They didn't  go through the stage of telephones being attached to buil dings. They've leapt into everybody  having a phone. And that's distributed by design.  It means everybody is connected to an information network. It has the potential of a far more  distributed future. Think, too, of energy. The 20th century energy model was oil rigs and pipelines  owned by large corporations who centralised the value in a few   hands.  21st century, we have solar panels and wind turbines, which can be dotted across houses and  schools and hospitals and government offices, and can be distributed in their ownership, so  people can own the capacity to generate energy, clean energy, which can   be an income stream  for a school, a house, a hospital, a home. These lower income countries, when they get the  investment to invest in that solar energy, can actually leapfrog towards a more distributed form.  And it's really important that as countries cre ate that clean energy system, it doesn't become
  owned and centralised in a few hands, but it actually fulfils its potential for being distributed by  design.  It's asking to be, because it's a distributed technology. Thinking about regenerative industries  again, we've all around the world inherited industries that are degenerative by design. But I think  many lower -   and middle - income countries that have also kept   closer to traditional practices, of  course, have been circular economies. There are, I'm sure, villages around the world that still  have a very circular relationship with the resources that are produced and the waste that is de -  composted and then regrown   in the village.  Strong connection with the materials that are locally available. And it's the stream of plastic  pollution that breaks that cycle. How can everybody in the world learn from those countries and  those societies that have actually long practised a circular sys tem? Even my own nation, I would  say 100 years ago, before the arrival of fossil fuels and plastics, had a much more circular system  in play in communities, in its use of textiles and woods and cloth and the soil.  We need to recover what our great - great - grandparents knew. We need to recover that and then  connect it with 21st century technologies of electrification through distributed solar and  renewable energy, through 21st century communications and technologies th at allow us for  ideas to travel through the commons so ideas can travel globally and materials circulate more  locally.  It's called cosmo - local production, and I think it's the future for rural economies, especially in the  global south. I think it brings the potential everywhere. Let me say that high - income countries,  they have the finances, they have the resources, for sur e. They also have the lock - in.  I was in London yesterday, a city that has been locked into cars, like many cities in the United  States, locked into the private car, locked into fossil energy, locked into transport networks and  energy systems that need to be dismantled. And there's a rea l struggle to unlock that lock - in. So  countries that are at the point of investing in the future of our energy system, in the future of  our transport system, that is a key moment.  Are we going to create a degenerative, divisive one that centralises value and locks us into  degenerative material use? Or are we going to leap, as we've all done with smartphones? Are we  going to leap to renewable energies and leap into circular manufactu ring? That to me is the  potential of this for lower - income countries to not make the mistakes and the degradations that  high - income countries have locked themselves into.
  Rohan Hazell:  While lower - income countries face the dual challenge of meeting people’s basic needs while  remaining within planetary boundaries, they can learn from the experiences of higher - income  nations and reimagine their pathways to prosperity to be more regenerativ e and distributive. For  their part, high - income nations can adopt more circular practices to minimise resource  consumption.  Sharing of ideas, learning and best practices through the commons and creating localised  solutions are therefore key to facilitating collaboration while also enabling countries to address  challenges that are unique to them.

The World Before the 20th Century 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair provided a historical overview of the pre-20th century factors that paved the way for globalisation as we know it today.Globalisation is not a recent phenomenon but has existed since antiquity, shaping interconnected networks of trade and culture across vast regions of the world, exemplified by the historical significance of the Silk Road.European colonisation in the 16th century, coupled with the subsequent Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, has shaped the contemporary global landscape, ushering in new paradigms of production, transportation, and energy utilisation.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The World Before the 20th Century  Rohan Hazell:  Our   modern   world   has   been   shaped   by   historical   events   that   have   affected   humanity  economically, socially, culturally, and politically. Centuries of human movement and exchange  have determined how we organise our societies, how we govern, and how our economies  function.  Today, we live in an increasingly connected world, both physically and virtually. But globalisation  is much more than simply removing barriers to movement, trade and innovation. To understand  globalisation better, we first need to identify the historical context. Chandran Nair, Chairman of  GIFT.ed, will describe how the world before the 20th century laid the foundation for modern  globalisation.  Chandran Nair:  The term, globalisation, is often used to describe things that we understand are the source of  much tension in the world today. What I'd like you to understand is that globalisation is as old as  the hills. Globalisation has been with humanity since the beginning of time, since a human  being walked the deserts, got lost on a little log, and landed in a different place, and met other  people, and as long as people traded. It's a long, old process.  It's also important to understand that much of what we experience today as part of the modern  world is essentially a result of events, historical events that started about five centuries ago.  So, the world before the 16th century was also a world that was globalised. The best example of  that globalised world is what is known today as the Silk Road. And that existed way before and  right up until, until the 15th century. During the silk Road, there was a rich, rich exchange of  trade, religion, knowledge, people, and cultures, right across central Asia, between China, India,  Iran, Iraq, the Middle East, Turkey, and right through to Europe, people were essentially getting  to mix with each other, they were getting to share religions knowledge, and the quest for more  interaction with others was part and parcel of the development of human civilisation.  
We saw the spread of Chinese and Islamic cultures, Christianity, and the land routes were open,  though some of them collapsed with the end of the Mongol empire. So, that was the period  before the 16th century. And then the 16th century was a turning point in human history and  much of what happened after that essentially defined what we know today as the modern  world.  In the mid-16 th   century, Spanish and Portuguese boats began what is known today as the  large-scale global colonisation period. They went both to trade and to spread religion, and in  the course of that essentially began to colonise large segments of Africa and other parts of the  world.  Portuguese shipping brought trade, science and Christianity to Asia. With it, it also brought  plunder and the oppression of people right across these parts, different parts of the world.  These trading missions and religious missions established enclaves, such as Macau and Malacca,  which also became trading hubs and until today are well-known places because of that  historical connection. The large-scale colonisation of Africa began in the 16th century, led by the  Portuguese and the Spanish.  The next phase in the development of the modern world was what can be loosely termed the  18th and 19th century, the dawn of the Industrial Age, the Industrial Revolution, and what is  now called the dawn of the Anthropocene. I will refer to that a bit more in a few minutes.  It saw the new manufacturing processes and organisation of labour in ways that allowed for  productivity to rapidly increase. Definitions of productivity that persist today are not that  relevant anymore to the way we need to organise ourselves and the way we need to look at our  economies.  The dawn of the Anthropocene was essentially a term coined in the last 20 years to refer to the  fact that since the industrial revolution and the discovery by human beings to use fossil fuels as  a source of energy, human beings have essentially started to reshape the nature of the planet.  The nature of the planet had for a long time been described through geological terms,  geological periods, hundreds of millions of years. But for the first time, human beings had  begun to change the very shape and nature of the planet and the term the Anthropocene was  coined. Essentially, it's the age of humans.  
It also saw in this, this particular period in human history, the development of mechanised  transport which is a reflection of the ability of human beings to essentially use fossil fuels and  the inventions of the steam engine, the combustion engine and all of those things that  revolutionised the way human beings live.  But at the same time, it was characterised by environmental degradation, air pollution, water  pollution, and large-scale ecological damage. It also brought about large-scale extinction of flora  and fauna. And a great example is the large-scale extinction of widespread destruction,  destruction of animals in North America, particularly the bison which is beginning to, to come  back.  And of course, at that time as well, we saw how human populations began to expand and  human populations are now at what's called the exponential curve of human population  increase.  Rohan Hazell:  Globalisation is not a new phenomenon, and nor is it static. From cultural exchanges along the  Silk Road to European colonisation of Africa, the Americas, and Asia, its form and impacts have  evolved in step with human civilisation.  At times this has been good for all parties involved. At other times, it has resulted in human  suffering and damage to the natural world.

Post-Western Geopolitics: Respecting Plurality

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter,  GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted that the evolving global landscape necessitates a recognition and respect for the plurality of political, economic, and cultural differences among nations.In a world characterised by diverse cultural values, governance models, and strategic priorities, both emerging and established powers need to acknowledge and respect these differences. Failure to do so can lead to geopolitical tensions and conflicts.Western powers, accustomed to holding significant sway in global affairs, may find it challenging to adjust to a more equitable distribution of power. However, rather than resisting change, these nations must embrace the idea of power-sharing for the greater good of global stability and prosperity.To ensure peace and shared prosperity in a post-Western world, all nations must recognise and respect political plurality. This requires adherence to certain geopolitical norms and a willingness to engage in cooperative efforts, regardless of ideological or cultural differences.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Post-Western Geopolitics: Respecting Plurality  Rohan Hazell:  Without a respect for plurality, navigating a world in which power and influence are more  diffuse than ever can easily result in geopolitical conflict.  Understandably, established powers are hesitant to relinquish control, while rising players are  eager to assert their voice.  But the scales of power are tilting to where no single nation can dictate the global agenda  anymore.  Thus, both emerging and established powers must be able to respect and accept the inherent  diversity of cultural values, governance models, and strategic priorities between them, even  when such differences pose challenges or create friction.  GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair, will walk us through the developments that are driving the  need for a greater respect for plurality to the forefront of the global conversation.  Chandran Nair:  So equity on the global platform, in terms of the power shifts, nobody knows where to exactly  go. But some things are clear. It is clear, and has been clear to anyone who's been watching. And  I can say humbly that I've been watching the rise of China for about 25 years, because I've had a  front row seat sitting in Hong Kong and going through China, witnessing a very poor nation  within the space of 25 years lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. It was inevitable  that this nation will then start to challenge most powerful nations in the world, because it has  the people, it has a good education system, it has a system of governance, which some don't  like, it's not palatable, it works for China and it would get organised, so it would start to  challenge the privacy of other powers.  We're already in the first phases of the post-Western world, and that has essentially been  accelerated in terms of the discussion and the diagnosis because of China and the reaction of  the West. China believes in a multipolar world and it has a large population. Any country with a  large population, like China and India, has to be wholly focused on managing that integrity of  
that state. So the Chinese argue, we have no interest in being number one, but we have great  interest in making sure we have a say in the world. But it's also fair to say that because it's so big  and it's so advanced, like any growing power, it will seek mainly to influence more, to protect its  own interests.  What does China's most interest be? Its most important interest will be as it grows. It needs  resources, and that's fundamentally the biggest challenge for any country. At this point, we can  see a tension. We see a tension between China and the United States. We see a tension  between Russia and the West in Europe, and we see the growing aspirations of an old  civilisation like India saying, we have a lot to offer the world, but we have a lot of people to take  care. So, like China, India will need a lot of resources.  In terms of land mass, most people will argue that India has no intentions of being the number  one power, but because it's large, because it has pride, its civilisation, it believes it has lots to  offer, it doesn't want to be sidelined, it wants to be part of the conversation, it wants to help.  But, like China, it'll need resources. How will you get resources? How will it become less  dependent on just a few nations?  So, coming to the Russia-Ukraine war, India has been criticised heavily by the West for buying oil  from Russia. And the Indians have been very clear that all we are interested in is getting access  to resources at the best prices we can. And that's what they are doing. The world changed  because of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is a terrible conflict, preoccupied everyone because it's  taking place in Europe and in a struggle that has elements of food, energy and  security at the centre of the European Union.  Once that conflict arose, all of that got disrupted, shipping lines got disrupted, and guess what?  Poor people from Africa to India to the Middle East were affected. What does that tell us? We  have a system that is essentially not that equitable, that it doesn't guarantee in the free market  system that the most vulnerable people and nations are protected from the actions of those  who are involved in a geopolitical struggle. We can't escalate the wars. We have to find ways to  live in a multipolar world. And that challenge, I think, is the most difficult for the Western  powers who have sat at the top for so long. And I don't mean that in a disparaging way. That is  important to understand, because those who've had power find it difficult to relinquish power.  They don't have to relinquish power, they need to learn to share. And that, I think, is the work  of the best and the brightest people, the true work of states people, and that the post-Western  world, the new world order, will have to be one that is based on plurality. Different political  systems, different economic systems, different systems of education, different cultures.  But in a way, all of our citizens of the world are benefiting from the best of both worlds.  
Rohan Hazell:  China is one of a handful of countries that has overcome its historical disadvantages.  It is now shaping the geopolitics of the post-Western world by promoting respect for political  plurality across nations.  However, if Western countries are not willing to accept the rise of nations like China, or if  non-Western nations are not willing to engage with the West according to certain geopolitical  norms, then tensions can arise.  It is therefore critical for global cooperation toward peace and shared prosperity that plurality  is not only recognised, but respected, by all nations.

The Importance of Localised Solutions: Lessons from Civil Society

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, KAM Morshed explored the importance of adapting solutions to local contexts - a valuable lesson for public and private sector organisations alike.It is imperative that solutions to challenges faced by local communities are implementable within their specific contexts and needs.BRAC's approach prioritises the involvement of local communities in driving solutions to their challenges, recognising that the people directly affected should be in the driving seat of decision-making processes.Western CSOs tend to impose solutions based on past successes and their centralised decision-making structures, which may not always align with the diverse needs of communities in different regions.Non-Western NGOs like BRAC can be more nimble, flexible, and decentralised in their decision-making processes, allowing for more efficient innovation and adaptation to local needs.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Importance of Localised Solutions:  Lessons from Civil Society  Host:  Large organisations around the world can   struggle to create solutions for local challenges, even  if they have plenty of resources at their disposal.  So how can businesses, governments, and civil society organisations work to overcome this  common challenge?  This is where an organisation like BRAC, working with marginalised communities across Asia and  Africa, has vast experience.  You'll hear from Mr. Kam Morshed, Senior Director of BRAC, on why localisation is key to  addressing the unique needs of these communities.  KAM Morshed:  Now, this is where the localisation or   locally led   actions are important. When, for example, I  talked about this, you know, adaptation centres. Yes, we are connected to MIT and their climate  work. We are connected to many of these so - called Ivy League institutions. But then we know  that whatever they are   saying is correct in an ideal situation, but not implementable in the  situation that we are in.  So, somebody needs to say whether it is implementable or not. And that's not   those institutions ,  that's not BRAC, that's really the people on the ground. So we know we are, for example, as part  of another global project, CREWSnet, we are working with MIT to do long - term climate  prediction. Now, knowing that the climate will be different in ten   years’ time   might be interesting,  but doesn't help the people to do anything.  So we need to figure, work with them, figure out whether, how they want to use   this information ,  what they can do with this information and what BRAC can do so that they can make the  information use it better. So, the driving seat must be occupied by the people who are facing this
  adversity. Global knowledge, global discourses only can give you, almost is a dead weight, if it is  not adopted to the local context.  All the climate change discussion in a rather   climate - controlled   environment is fantastic. But if  you look at what is being done, there are thousands and thousands of pilots involving 2,000  people, 3,000 cattle, 500 villages. Those programmes are not replicable in a hundred thousand  villages, because hundred thousand v illages have 10,000 typologies. So, how do you do that?  So you bring all this work, use it as, if you may, almost a background knowledge, but then work  with the people, see what they want to do and in doing what they want to do, use the knowledge  that is already there.  So, I think this is almost flipping the coin here on the head. That approach is necessary. You  cannot expect that even a Nobel laureate knows what is needed in a village in Bangladesh. But  what he knows, the Nobel laureate knows can be translated, can be u sed in designing a solution  that the villagers want to design.  Host:  In their efforts to address global challenges, certain large civil society organisations sometimes  fall into the trap of setting universal benchmarks that may not always align with the needs of  local communities in diverse regions. While their intentions m ay be good, the tendency to ascribe  one - size - fits - all policies informed by previous successes can lead to unintended consequences  and ultimately hinder the effectiveness of their initiatives. To illustrate how this can play out, Mr  Morshed will explain how   BRAC has successfully navigated these challenges by adopting a more  localised, community - driven approach.  KAM Morshed:  I think Western NGOs who are older NGOs, they had the advantage of having a solution book in  their back pocket because they have seen it all. It may be natural that after 80 years of existence,  90 years of existence, coming from the North, you have the con fidence that the moment you see  a problem, you tend to jump into a solution that might have worked 30 years ago in another  country in a different context. And I've seen that many of these NGO and even some multilaterals,  almost promote cookbooks for soluti ons.
  Southern NGOs are newer. We don't have cookbooks. We don't have the luxury of having a  cookbook. And our approach to working with the community, instead of a technocratic top - down  model, I think makes us humble and makes us realise that we ourselves cannot   solve any  problem. It has to be the people themselves who need to be willing to solve the problem.  And they know better, they should choose how they want to solve it.  NGO can actually facilitate the solution mechanism. I think that is one difference. The other  difference is, again, how do you take projects? You know, as I said, the Northern NGOs often have  their projects, their ideas, all coming from the Northern contex t. So, you know, something that  might have worked in the USA is not going to work in Africa, for example. Where decisions are  made in Northern NGOs, most of these NGOs are international, very big, and work in 30  countries. But their decisions are centralis ed because of the bureaucratic structure that was  there because mostly they imitated the other public bureaucracy in their design, the structural  design.  Southern NGOs are much nimbler in size, much nimbler in their structure, and very flexible. So,  decisions are often pushed downwards very efficiently. And this is where innovation can happen  much easily in the case of the Southern NGOs. But then there are   also benchmarks. What is right,  what is wrong? Because you are in, say, 40 countries, there is a tendency to set a benchmark  which is right for a single benchmark for all 40 countries. Let me give you an example.  For all refugee settings, the benchmark is the refugees will be given table salt. Now, in  Bangladesh, we don't produce table salt, or we don't call it table salt, we just have   salt,   and the  entire Bangladesh consumes salt. So salt, Bangladesh is a major producer of salt, but not table  salt. So, the refugees in Bangladesh, when the international NGOs and actors work with them,  they have to import table salt in a situation where there   is an extreme funding crisis. But when  BRAC works, we don't have the table salt standard because we don't think table salt is something  that needs to be ensured and even at three times more the cost, so we are free to adapt to the  local needs.  One can criticise us that you're not following the standards set by, I don't know, maybe WHO or  some big thing. But I don't think the refugees also want table salt and they never had table salt  when they were in Myanmar and there isn’t any demand for that.   And the salt that Bangladesh  consumes, the entire Bangladesh is not any inferior or much inferior that you cannot consume  them.
  So these sort of things are, again, maybe probably because the structural or the centralised  nature of these Western NGOs is different between Western and Southern NGOs. How can  Western NGOs adopt this? I think many, there are many attempts now. They are t rying to adopt  to a decentralised model, but then for any large organisation like those, it takes time. But I see  the intention is there. You see, there are attempts made by larger international NGOs to achieve  that goal, if you will.  Host:  As most CSOs based in the non - Western world tend to be younger than their Western  counterparts, they don’t have the luxury of long track records of successful initiatives.  But while non - Western CSOs can learn from these successes, it’s important to remember that a  top - down decision - making model based on Western standards isn’t always appropriate.  As Mr. Morshed has   described   a programme that was successful in the United States, may not  necessarily translate to countries in Africa.  This underscores just how important it is to have a nuanced understanding of local contexts when  crafting strategies and solutions for the marginalised, rooted firmly in their respective localities.

Principal Objective 1: Protecting Public and Common Goods

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Chandran Nair explained the distinction between public and common goods, underscoring the state's responsibility to ensure their provision and protection.Public goods like potable water, public transport, and healthcare are essential for equitable societies but cannot be effectively provided by the free market alone. Government oversight and regulation are crucial to prevent social disruptions and ensure fair access, especially in critical sectors like healthcare.Common goods, such as clean air and biodiversity, are shared resources vital for societal wellbeing. Governments must intervene to protect these goods, as unchecked economic activity can lead to socially destructive outcomes and environmental degradation.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Principal Objective 1:  Protecting Public and Common Goods  Elaine Fernandez:  The first principal objective of the state is to protect public and common goods. You’ll learn what  this means with Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed.  He’ll explain the critical distinctions between public and common goods, and why the state   -   and  not the free market   -   bears the primary responsibility in their provision and protection.  Chandran Nair:  So I've referred to public and common goods and it's very important to understand the difference  so that you really understand why it's the state that has to take the lead responsibility. It can  have other actors involved in the provision and the protectio n of that. Public goods are essentially  goods and services that are essential for a thriving community, for a society to essentially be fair  and equitable, but which cannot be provided adequately by simply resorting to the free market.  So what are the examples of those?  An example of that would be the provision of potable water in cities. You can't simply privatise  water provisions so that private companies can charge whatever they want because they're  driven by a profit motive. Then it is essentially hijacking of public   goods by private markets. And  that's why most privatisation, when done properly, has government oversight. They regulate the  price, et cetera. It's not a free for all.  Where there have been examples of free for all, there have been huge social disruptions and  governments have had to change. Other areas would be the ambulance   service,   and we saw  through the COVID where in advanced economies, particularly the United States, where public  health had been privatised to the free market, the consequences were disastrous. Thousands of  people died because they couldn't have access. And increas ingly the privatisation of health
  because governments are failing to provide the public goods to the high standards needed, is a  major problem in all countries.  If you can't afford it and if you come from lower income groups, the likelihood is you'll suffer  grave illnesses and hundreds of thousands of people die because the state is not able, able to  provide. Another example would be for public goods that you can' t privatise.  If you take a bridge, if you're   trying to   connect communities in rural areas, to enhance the  economy, to allow people to trade, to travel, et cetera, then those bridges and across a large river  or highway cannot be done by the private sector. They will not invest in it. It has to be done by  the s tate. And then at a certain stage, when the economies begin to flourish, there might be  opportunities to privatise some elements of that service, but we wholly privatise   it,   and it doesn't  work.  So that's the public good. Now, what are common goods? Common goods are essentially goods  that are shared across populations, where everyone draws upon the benefits of those goods and  services. The most obvious one would be to protect a common good would b e the air we breathe.  The government has a huge responsibility to provide people with clean air. And because we've  entered into this industrialised, urbanised economy in such a rapid fashion, governments were  not able to keep up.  The second problem was that many of them thought that if the economy grows, we can fix  everything else later. So we had mass urbanisation, private car ownership, because apparently,  if the automobile industry is a catalyst for industrialisation, we can't d o anything to prevent that.  And we all know what's happened across most parts of the world.  So in most cities, the air quality is deteriorated to an extent that I think the WHO says that nine  out of ten cities currently don't even meet WHO standards for air quality in the cities. So air  quality is a common good that the state has an obligation. H ow it intervenes, then, is the  governance system. If the governance system is weak, then it's not able to essentially bring  together the private interests of economic actors who think their interests should be the interest  of the state. But the interest of   private economic actors is not the interest of the state. And that's  why it's so important to understand.  The government's role is not to allow economic activity that is socially destructive, so it must  protect common goods. In the same way, it has an obligation to make sure that biodiversity is  protected, not because it likes tigers and elephants necessarily,   but because biodiversity is now
  understood as such a fundamental part of our economy. And there is governance, social  protection, because of biodiversity benefits, and then economic activity that needs to be  curtailed if it is such an impinge on biodiversity.  So those are the common goods. Air quality, soils, water, all the things that societies   share,   and  markets cannot provide either.  Elaine Fernandez:  Public goods are essential for a well - functioning society, such as clean drinking water and public  transport. Common goods are shared within and across countries, such as air quality and  biodiversity. These cannot always be provided or protected adequately   by the private sector.  Why? Because the profit motive does not encourage businesses to manage public and common  goods in a way that is sustainable and affordable for the long term.  This is why the government has an obligation to provide and protect these resources, set ground  rules for private sector involvement, and to intervene in any economic activity that is harmful to  people or the planet.

Revisiting the Sustainability Timeline

### keyTakeaway
Sustainability has been influenced by various cultures and thinkers beyond the European and American contexts. The traditional sustainability narrative is predominantly Western-focused, overlooking significant non-Western contributions.Sustainability is more than protecting the environment. It encompasses the iterative improvement of our economic systems, socioeconomic development, governance, and more.Sustainability is not static. It varies across cultures, geographies, governance systems, and developmental stages. There is no “one size fits all” approach to sustainability.Ultimately, recognising non-Western perspectives on sustainability is crucial for creating effective global solutions that take into account different perspectives and desired outcomes.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Revisiting The Sustainability Timeline  Rohan Hazell:  In the last chapter, we explored some of the major milestones that have led to the  conceptualisation of sustainability as we know it today. You may have noticed something  about this timeline. It's almost entirely defined by the contribution of European and   American  thinkers, governments and organisations. But of course, their non - Western counterparts have  had major influences on the modern understanding of sustainability.  Unfortunately,   however,   these   contributions   are   rarely   recognised   in   the   canon   of  sustainability. Now it's important that we do so because the challenge of sustainable  development is a global   one and   will need solutions from all parts of the world tailored to  local contexts.  So, let's revisit the timeline.  As far back as the 9th to 13th centuries in the Middle East, Arabic treaties dealt with early  environmental science, covering subjects like air and water pollution, soil contamination and  even the mishandling of municipal solid waste. They even included as sessments of certain  localities' impacts on the surrounding environment. And if we look at the last century alone,  there are many other examples.  In the 1930s, Mahatma Gandhi introduced concepts of sustainability to the international  community through his philosophy of non - violence, termed Ahimsa and self - sufficiency, or  Swaraj. These principles aimed at achieving harmony with nature as well as equi table social  and economic outcomes.  In 1970, Vietnamese Zen master monk Thich Nhat Hanh and his colleagues Chan Kong and  Alfred Hassler organised a first - of - its - kind international environmental conference. The effort  culminated in a statement entitled "A   m essage to   o ur 3.5   billion   n eighbours on   P lanet   E arth  from 2,200   e nvironmental   s cientists."  Across the world in Kenya, also in the 1970s, Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmentalist,  founded the Green Belt Movement, promoting environmental conservation, women's rights  and economic empowerment, typifying a holistic approach to sustainability decade s ahead of  its time. And in 2004, she won a Nobel Peace Prize for her work.
  Then there's Mustafa Kamal Tolba, an Egyptian scientist who acted as the second Executive  Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. During his 17 years in office, he led  the development of the Montreal Protocol, which is an international treaty   designed to  protect the ozone layer. It remains to this day as one of the only international environmental  efforts that has resulted in a successful outcome, saving millions from skin cancer and other  impacts. He also steered the Basel Convention to reduc e international   pollution and   helped  set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which is the world's foremost  voice on climate change today.  In the 2000s, we see China proposing a new form of development under the banner of  "ecological civilisation" to replace "industrial civilisation". Again, this is a very different model  than Western counterparts, and began to be enacted in 2011.  In 2008, Bhutan gained international attention for setting Gross National Happiness as its  national metric for growth instead of GDP. The aim was to prioritise physical, mental, social  and environmental well - being over GDP, or purely monetary terms of refe rence. And of  course, let us not forget that ecological awareness was first recorded up to 5,000 years ago in  Indian Vedas, which are ancient poems.  The teachings of Taoists, Jains and Buddhists, as with other religions, all include a respect for  nature. The philosophy of Ubuntu shared by various African nations, meaning "I am because  we are" or "humanity towards others". Or the Native American concept   of "Seven Generation  Sustainability", which advocates for decision - making that considers impacts on seven  generations into the future.  These philosophies are returning to influence modern - day discussions on sustainability  around the world. Importantly, these are just a handful of the contributions made by non -  Western thinkers and organisations. Many more remain unclear simply because they   are not  in a global language, nor in our education systems.  So, what are the key takeaways from this timeline of sustainability? First, sustainability is not  just environmental protection. Although the concept has its roots in re - evaluating the  relationship between humans and the environment, it now also encompasse s economic  systems, socio economic development, governance mechanisms and much more.  Second, sustainability is clearly not a static concept. It has evolved across time and it will  continue to change. There is no universal understanding of sustainability because views on it  depend on culture, geography, governance, level of development and   much more.  Third, sustainability is not just a Western concept. Although most common understandings of  sustainability may cite Western contributions, sustainability is a global challenge, one that  requires listening to voices and ideas from around the world. Failing   to do so will only limit
  our potential to create sustainable solutions through policymaking, innovative business  models, and international collaboration.  To get a better understanding of the global sustainability challenges we face, you'll hear from  two of the world's most renowned sustainability experts in the next chapter, Dr. Jane Goodall  and Professor Jeffrey Sachs.

Redesigning Society: The Importance of Community and Environmental Wellbeing 

### keyTakeaway
This chapter underscored the interconnectedness of different societies and the urgency to address environmental and social challenges collectively to ensure the continued prosperity of humanity. People around the world find great satisfaction in helping others, highlighting the intrinsic human desire to contribute positively to others' wellbeing. Recognising the complexity of organising globally for the wellbeing of humanity, Professor Korten called for new institutions, governance models, and ways of organising businesses that prioritise wellbeing and sustainability over profit. Professor Korten stressed the importance of local self-organisation, where communities manage relationships with their environment to create the conditions essential for wellbeing.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Society: The Importance of Community  and Environmental Wellbeing  Rohan Hazell:  The importance of the relationship between community and environmental wellbeing   is often  dismissed by traditional economic thinking.  But former Harvard Business School Professor David Korten suggests that sustainable economic  models should take into account   local self - organisation, the governance of new institutions, and  community - centred business models.  Prof. David Korten:  What gives most mentally healthy and aware humans their greatest satisfaction is   actually being  of help to others. I found this almost universally in my living around the world, not only in  Southeast Asia, but also in Latin America and Africa. And often the people you could most reliably  turn to for help were often the most visibly poo r.  And I think this is an absolutely foundational issue as we begin to look out and recognise that no  one ultimately benefits from a dead Earth. And if we do not come together to support one  another in healing the Earth and ensuring that every person has the   access to the essential  necessities of a sound material life, we're essentially creating a world in which not only our  generation or our coming generations will all die. There's no hope for our children, our whole  species. And we may set back the evolution   of life and the process in ways that might take  thousands, even millions of years for Earth to recover, which would be kind of the ultimate  human crime against creation.  So this sets the frame for the need for very, very deep and powerful change. But it also is a time  of visioning together. What is the world that is within our means to create a world of material  sufficiency and spiritual abundance? For all of Earth's peopl e, in which we live together in mutual  peace and prosperity, defined not by material excess, but by spiritual aliveness.
  So when you talk about what do we have to do? my sense is that the first step is the conversation,  just exactly like we're having now, in which we all come to a recognition of, oh, well, first of all,  we're all in this together. But second of all, we're al l living beings. We all depend on the health  not only of one another, what South Africans call ubuntu, which translates I am because you are,  or I am because we are. Oh, and my wellbeing ultimately depends on your well being, and it  depends on the wellbeing of earth and essentially all of Earth's beings. And then this puts you  into a totally different frame of what does our economy have to do?  How do we need to organise our relationships with one another and Earth? doing in a way that  maintains the health of earth and maintains the wellbeing of all its people? Now, anybody that  thinks they have a total simple answer to ‘How do we do this?’ doesn 't understand the problem.  And it's a problem in which we all have to engage in the solutions and we need support from  politicians. But part of the deepest understanding of this that  I see is that life organises locally everywhere. You know, go back to these cells in our body. This  is a highly localised process of self - organisation by living beings, through processes that are still  far beyond our human understanding. We have barely a c lue how our body does this, let alone  how does Earth do it. You know, my particular academic field happens to be business  organisations. How do we organise businesses?  Organise businesses to make a profit? No, no, no.  The real challenge is how do we organise our communities, ourselves, as a global species to  secure the living of life? And that is so much more complex. And the only way we're going to  learn to do it is doing it together, where we're all engaging in our lo calities, in managing our  relationships to our soil, to our supplies of water, to climatic systems, so that we are making our  own living through forms of agriculture and housing and infrastructure and so forth, that support  us in essentially supporting one   another.  And out of that, we need to develop fundamentally new institutions, new ways of governing  ourselves, new ways of organising business that are not just democratic in the sense of we have  an election every few years to choose a new super leader at the top, b ut how do we actually  organise, as living beings in community, to create and maintain the conditions essential  to our well being and to the continued health and wellbeing of Earth?  It's very hard to tell what's happening all around the world. My sense is that partly as a result of  the disruptions of COVID that we are becoming much more aware of how broken the global
  system is, and the imperative of our learning to organise locally as communities that are  dedicated to maintaining the health of Earth and the wellbeing of one another in the place where  we live.  Rohan Hazell:  Redesigning society requires a paradigm shift in our relationships   with each other and with the  environment.  This means reimagining existing institutions meant to facilitate socioeconomic   development and  creating new ones to address and seize emergent challenges and opportunities. Involving local  communities in this   endeavour and   supporting them in managing their resource base to achieve  self - sufficiency will be integral to an economic redesign.

Culture Shifts of the Post-Western World

In this chapter, Professor Kishore Mahbubani discussed the cultural renaissance of the East and the mutual benefits of cultural exchange with the West.Alongside the economic resurgence of Asia, there will also be a cultural renaissance. Given the rich history of civilisations like China, India, and Southeast Asia, there's anticipation for a significant revival in cultural expression and creativity.The increasing export of cultural goods from Asian countries, like K-Pop and Bollywood, illustrates how cultural products are contributing to the global cultural landscape.Rather than viewing the rise of non-Western cultural influences as a threat, the West should embrace it for its benefit. Enrichment through cultural exchange can lead to mutual growth and understanding.

TRANSCRIPT  Culture Shifts of the Post-Western World  Rohan Hazell:  The cultural tapestry of the 20th century, arguably even stretching back to the renaissance, has  been heavily threaded with Western influences. From Hollywood blockbusters to influences on  music, sports and pop culture in general, Western norms have set the global stage.  But as the world order veers to world multipolarity, the vestiges of old powers in the East are  stirring, awakening dormant cultural wells, bringing about a renaissance of the rest.  Let’s hear more about the cultural shifts on the horizon from Professor Kishore Mahbubani,  former President of the UN Security Council, and Distinguished Fellow at the Asian Research  Institute.  Professor Kishore Mahbubani:  I think the real excitement from the resurgence of Asia is going to come from the cultural  dimension, because Asia has always had the world's oldest civilisations in China, India and  Southeast Asia. And as you know, history teaches us that when civilisations come back, they first  have an economic resurgence, which is what you're seeing in Asia. But following the economic  resurgence, you will see a cultural renaissance take place. And the most exciting thing that  you're going to see over the next 20 - 30 years is the major renaissance of our great Asian  civilisations, like the Chinese civilisation, the Indian civilisation, the Islamic civilisation, and also  many Southeast Asian societies. So the next 20 - 30 years will be fascinating. And here I must  say that a few countries have led the way.  I would say India in some ways has led the way with its cultural exports. I remember many years  ago when I was travelling in Morocco, in the middle of the desert in Morocco, I heard the songs  of Muhammad Rafi. And I, of course, listen to the songs of Muhammad Rafi every day, because  without listening to Mohammed Rafi, I cannot do my writing.  
And similarly, what is equally shocking is the explosion of the cultural export from South Korea  to the rest of the world. I met people in the United States who spend all their time watching  Korean soap operas, because Korean soap operas are among the best in the world.  Therefore, you will find also, just as you'll see a resurgence of material goods being exported  from Asia, you'll see an equally strong resurgence of cultural goods being exported from Asia.  And of course, the cultural renaissance of Asia is something that the whole world can enjoy,  including people living in the United States and Europe.  Well, my main message to them is that for those who live in the non-Western world, this is the  most exciting and the best decades for the non-Western world. I mean, certainly if you see the  success, especially of China over the last 40 years, in the year 1980, China's GDP in purchasing  power parity terms was only 10% of the United States, 10%. But by 2014, 34 years later, it had  become bigger. So the Chinese people have just experienced the best 30 to 40 years in 4,000  years of Chinese history.  Similarly, I believe that the people of India are about to experience the best 30 years in Indian  history under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in 3,000 years of Indian history.  All the societies in Asia and Africa now have tremendous opportunities to improve the standard  of living of their people. So I believe therefore, that we Asians should not be drowned by the  pessimism that you find in the Western world.  We should focus on developing ourselves and if possible, share our optimism with the Western  world. Because the Western world seems to believe that the growth and development of Asian  societies, including China and India and ASEAN, is a negative for them. Whereas we should  persuade them that the success of the rest of the world, the 88% who live outside the West, is a  plus for the Western world and the West should take advantage of these opportunities.  So my big piece of advice to all the people who live in the non-Western world is please try to  share your optimism with those who live in the West and maybe then they will stop resisting  the rise of the rest.  Rohan Hazell:  Although the post-Western world will see rising powers like China and India having greater  influence on the global stage, this does not mean that the West will become redundant.  
Rather, Professor Kishore argues that the multilateral rules-based order set up by the West,  including the UN, should be preserved, and strengthened for the benefit of all.  This will require the West to become more accepting of sharing power with non-Western  countries and respecting their wants.  This is the geopolitical reality facing the West, and neglecting it could lead to unwelcome  tension and even conflict.

The Case for a Strong State

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson underscored the need for robust, resilient institutions and effective leadership to address existential challenges while maintaining social and economic balance. A strong state is characterised not by authoritarianism but by competent authority. It encompasses effective institutions and leadership that work for the common good, rather than relying on symbols of force like large armies or coercion. The division between political leadership and civil service is vital. Political leaders set agendas and make trade-offs but must not be captive to private interests. The civil service implements these policies and regulations, adapting them to local circumstances and ensuring effective delivery of services. A strong state also depends on its people's recognition of collective welfare. Societies with a strong social contract, where people are willing to work together for common goals, exhibit features of a strong state. A strong state is not synonymous with big government. Big government often implies an overly controlling role in the economy, leading to negative economic impacts and corruption, which can erode the social contract and undermine the strength of the state.

  TRANSCRIPT  The Case for a Strong State  Elaine Fernandez:  Governments around the world have been accused of being too authoritative, often with good  reason.  But what does this mean for how much power a government should be allowed to wield? How  “strong” should a State be?   After all, the State has an overwhelming number of responsibilities  to its citizens and other nations, meaning a certain amount of power is needed.  To explore this further, you’ll hear from Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global Institute  For Tomorrow.  Eric Stryson:  So what is the case for a strong state?  I think it's obvious that redesigning society requires a strong government and strong leadership  within government. The kind of government needed to address existential challenges like climate  change, like biodiversity loss, like the proliferation of plast ic waste in the environment. These are  existential challenges.  And the kind of government that is needed is not determined by political systems as such, but  really by the ability of the state to deliver outcomes to its people, promote national development,  and adapt to changing conditions. A strong state is more than   just the government. Indeed, it's a  combination of all actors within society that operate and contribute to national development.  Robust and resilient institutions are the foundation of a strong state, providing essential services  and guiding the growth of   communities, guiding the growth of businesses, civil society.  It means that even in times of political crisis, the civil service is capable of operating and delivering  outcomes. They are able and willing to do what it takes to deliver clean water, clean and healthy  food, reliable electricity, good quality, accessible   education, healthcare, and all of the basic needs
  of society. It's important to appreciate that a strong state is not defined by any particular political  system or political party.  The effective division between political leadership and the institutions of the state, the   institution  of the civil service is essential. Political leaders, whether they are elected or otherwise, are the  ones who set the broad agenda. They decide on trade - offs. They essentially write the rules. But  it's important that they are not captive to private intere sts and that there are essentially  institutional watchdogs to protect the interests of the majority.  The bureaucracy and the civil service are those that then implement the rules and adapt them to  the local circumstances. It gives feedback to the political leaders who then set the agenda going  forward. That split between political leaders and the civil se rvice has a huge impact on how the  rules are written, how they're executed, and ultimately, how society experiences the outcomes  of those rules.  We should remember that there is an essential role for the people within a strong state. So  societies where there is a high degree of recognition of collective welfare, of the common good,  these are places where the people are more willing and able to work   together to solve their social  problems. Places where there is great social division or polarisation in society are often unable  to come together, achieve consensus and address their problems effectively.  And ultimately, governments, we should understand, are run by the people. The people power.  Countries that have a constructive, effective social contract amongst its citizenry, share  important features of a strong state. That social contract, which is esse ntially the tacit agreement  of what is acceptable and not acceptable in society, what it is that you and I owe each other as  members of a society.  When that is well defined, well understood and strong within a society, then we also have the  features of a strong state. One example would be Japan. There is an unspoken rule in Japan of  taking care of others around us and in society at large.  In Japan, we see high levels of volunteerism. There is peace and stability and offers of support  during times of natural disasters. There is a much, much lower incidence of things like petty theft  and day - to - day crime. Of course, it's not a perfect society , but there is a social contract in Japan,  which is unusual as compared to many other societies in the world.  So what is a strong state, really?
  Strong and competent institutions that are trusted by society to convey accurate information, to  make decisions when needed, to take actions fairly and swiftly –   these are characteristics of a  strong state. A strong state has an effective decision - making fr amework that is invested with  competence and expertise. It demonstrates strong obligations within society, whereby each  group within society understands their duties, their obligations, their responsibilities towards  each other, and therefore enables an ef fective social contract.  So it's important that we remember that a strong state is not the same as an authoritarian state.  Authority is not the same as authoritarian. These are often mixed up in the popular press. So the  usual symbols of strength which we associate with strong cou ntries, strong government, like  images of large armies, images of tanks rolling through the street, advanced weaponry. Actually,  these count very little when it comes to a strong state.  And how well a government manages its resources, how well it invests in the future of its people  in   promoting   socioeconomic   development   and   social   harmony.   So   a   state   that   needs  demonstrations of force is not a strong state, necessarily. Coercion can reall y undermine the  social contract and essentially represents a lack of trust in the government.  I think when we talk about a strong state, it's also important to distinguish it from big  government. So a strong state is not necessarily a big government, nor is a big government  necessarily a strong state. So big government is a term that is often used   to describe when states  play an outsized or overly controlling role within the nation's economy.  A big government might use state - owned enterprises to monopolise and build certain strategic  industries, like telecommunications, oil and gas, or defence rather than working towards public  benefit, many state - owned companies often end up helping the govern ment officials who run  them. This is not a feature or quality of a strong state. In fact, this dynamic within the economy  often undermines a strong state. It erodes public trust and confidence in the   government,   and it  leads to corruption and negative economic impacts which erode the social contract and  undermine a strong state.  So, of course, when we look at examples of a strong and effective state, Singapore comes to  mind. A small city state, transformed from a poor country with very little resources, transformed  from 1960, when it had a GDP per capita of $430, to today, somewhe re in the order of $65,000.  It has a great strong and committed civil service which serves the needs of the people. It has  controlled corruption effectively. It's accountable.
  One of the great achievements of Singapore was its public housing programme, which really  recognised the fundamental need in a society to get people into houses which were safe, which  were secure, which were managed, and led to the fostering of communities   and giving people a  sense of place, a sense of pride. I think things that Singapore did in terms of investing in  education, promoting meritocracy amongst its civil service, and of course, all of the efforts that  the state made in investing in development   of the city state itself, investing in technology, looking  ahead at trends, all of these actions by the government really enabled Singapore to achieve  remarkable development over the last 50, 60 years.  So   over the   past   five to   six   decades,   Singapore's   government   worked   to   develop   key  infrastructure. It provided accessible, affordable housing for its people, it pumped investment  into high quality education, and created a competitive, world - class business   environment. And  really underlying all of this is the quality of the Singapore civil service that is based on meritocracy,  is held accountable, resistant to corruption and responds to the needs of its people.  Elaine Fernandez:  The term “Strong State” might be off - putting to some. But strong in this context does not mean  authoritarian.  A strong State can only occur when all actors within society cooperate for common good. Robust  and resilient institutions are the foundation, providing essential services and guiding the growth  of communities, businesses, and civil society.  Ultimately, a strong state must earn the right to lead, with a social contract that places public  trust at the centre.

Externalities of Services 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson delved into the externalities stemming from pervasive service-based technologies, from increasing cybercrime in the IT industry to declining mental health due to social media, as well as the risks and inequities of the financial sector.The IT sector poses both known and unforeseen risks to society, including the exponential growth of global cybercrime, which is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.The Internet of Things (IoT) introduces significant vulnerabilities as more devices become interconnected, potentially exposing critical infrastructure such as banking systems, air traffic control, and energy grids to hackers.The algorithms dictating the content we consume daily, designed by profit-seeking big tech companies, are increasingly contributing to a decline in mental health and a rise in social unrest, which is extensively documented.The financial sector's evolution, characterised by increased financialisation, has led to rising inequality and systemic risks, as evidenced by the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Externalities of Services  Elaine Fernandez:  Unlike physical products with readily measurable footprints, the externalities of our daily  services, from healthcare to transportation, can be harder to gauge.  After all, can we truly quantify the environmental impact or social cost of a service like banking?  Although seemingly intangible, these hidden effects do cast a long shadow, shaping our  communities and the environment in ways we rarely consider.  Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global Institute For Tomorrow, takes us through some of  the externalities inherent in services, focusing on the tech and finance industries.  Eric Stryson:  I think when it comes to the IT sector - information technology - we have started to become  aware of some of the negative impacts on society and the systemic risks. But I would argue  there are, as yet, many unimagined risks in the IT sector that we need to be aware of.  The global pandemic of cyber-crime is expected to reach somewhere in the order of $10.5  trillion annually by 2025. So, we are increasingly vulnerable to hacks, both at the personal level  and in our businesses and our organisations.  Governments have experienced the fact that our personal financial health and location data are  all online and in apps, has presented new risks for financial crime and for hackers, although that  has been central to the monetisation of new technology and new internet businesses.  So, internet businesses and apps have been premised on capturing our location data, our  personal data, our browsing history. But all of that, many citizens within society are now very  much aware that it poses risks to both their personal and financial wellbeing.  But then just imagine the world that we are racing towards with the Internet of Things, where  every device is connected through sensors, we have facial recognition, AI, and connected  sensors on all of our vehicles, our office buildings, the streetlights, and everywhere we go, we  interact with devices that are connected.  
This is the Internet of things. This is the future which many who trumpet the 4 th   Industrial  Revolution are eager to race towards. But imagine the vulnerabilities. We could even say these  are exponential vulnerabilities in society for hackers when all of our banking systems, our air  traffic control, our energy systems, GPS, logistics, everything is connected through sensors and  microdevices. This will open up a vast new risk landscape in society.  We should also understand that the behaviour influencing algorithms that we are increasingly  interacting with in our professional lives and in our personal lives are causing great new  concerns around mental health as well as basic productivity. We are being distracted by  algorithms all day long. It's even a factor in our social stability.  So, in the beginning I talked about the pillars of a stable and prosperous society. I would argue  that profit-making algorithms are slowly eroding some of those pillars because they are  influencing how we interact with one another and therefore influencing that social contract and  even social stability.  I think the negative externalities of social media are now well-documented. They have been  rightly   accused   of   spreading   hate speech, spreading disinformation, and in general, just  polarising societies in unhealthy ways.  The mental health implications of spending too much time interacting with social media has  also been well documented. Depression has overtaken anxiety as the largest mental health  concern amongst US college students and in general, the time that we increasingly spend online  has negatively influenced our attention spans and has reduced our attention span, and I would  argue reduced overall productivity.  So, there are externalities in the banking and finance sector. We can understand the banking  and finance sector as providing both assets and liabilities to society. The globalisation of finance  has provided great benefits through increased liquidity, increased access to capital both for  individuals, for SMEs, small businesses, and larger businesses.  Yet the structure of large institutions, what has been called “too big to fail”, has led to the  accusations of the socialisation of losses and the privatisation of profit. Clearly the financial  crisis of 2007 and 2008 was the most visible example of the vast negative impacts on society  from the over-financialisation of our economy and the externalisation of these risks to society.  So, banks have had a tendency to privatise the profit and socialise the risk. And in the case of  the financial crisis in 2009, to socialise the losses.  The financialisation of our economy has been blamed for rising inequality and systemic risks. In  1945, finance accounted for only about 10% of US GDP. By 2020, that figure had risen to more  
than 22%. So, the US economy has experienced a great financialisation, and the relative weight  of finance in the economy has grown greatly.  Now at the same time, we need to understand that banks play a key role as intermediaries to  safeguard our assets and to provide access to funds and to liquidity. But since the financial crisis  the public has demanded much stronger oversight by regulators, and that's a good thing. So, we  need to find ways to internalise the externalised costs of banking  Elaine Fernandez:  Our profit-driven economic paradigm has fueled the rapid proliferation of a range of services,  with little consideration for their ramifications.  IT services, for all its benefits, also has the potential to undo the very progress it facilitates.  Ever-increasing cyber-crime, Big Tech’s consolidation of power and influence, and deteriorating  mental health are just a few manifestations of this.  Likewise,   the   realm   of   banking   and   finance,   though   indispensable,   is   marred   by   the  disproportionate concentration of power within major financial institutions, prompting worries  regarding the socialisation of losses and the privatisation of profits as evidenced by the fallout  from the 2007-2008 financial crisis.  Thus, education around externalities, combined with bold leadership, is required to rethink  business models, account for externalities, and rebalance profit-making and societal wellbeing.

Redesigning the Economy: Education and Collaboration

### keyTakeaway
Professor Korten believes that the upcoming decade is crucial for initiating behavioural changes aligned with long-term societal goals. In particular, he believes that collective transformation to secure a better future rests on the shoulders of the younger generation. We are witnessing the decline of the old economic system, which is creating space for the emergence of fundamentally new institutions in governance, business, education, science, and religion. If we are to move from “emergency to emergence,” young people must challenge traditional educational models, moving beyond passive learning to actively questioning and seeking new answers. The goal for the younger generation is not to gain power within existing institutions but to transform them, which will require innovative approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning the Economy: Education and Collaboration  Rohan Hazell:  In the face of urgent environmental challenges, education serves as one of our most important  tools.  But as former Harvard Business School Professor David Korten suggests, we first need to  recognise the current educational system's limitations, often rooted in outdated models and  resistant to change.  Professor Korten proposes that students and educators should collaboratively rethink these  models in order to nurture a generation ready to spearhead transformative change.  Prof. David Korten:  You know, I try to use my time as best I can, just for conversations like this, to share what I can.  But the transformation that we have to navigate as a species, if we're to have a common future,  absolutely depends on the younger generation, the new generation coming forward. And to take  our frame from the The Club of Rome has a frame from emergency to emergence.  And what that means is the science tells us, in terms of the climate issues, we have to make a  dramatic start in changing our behaviours by the end of the current decade, or it may be too late  in terms of nature's natural trigger points. So that has to be   done essentially within the frame of  the   existing   institutions.   There's   no   way   we   can   possibly   achieve   this   kind   of   deeper  transformation that we've been discussing. But those emergency actions have to be taken in  ways that are consistent with the long ter m transformation of our species.  And it's essential that our young people understand the nature of what's happening. This diagram  may be helpful. I call this the Great Turning. Now, what we're in is a time when this spiral, the old  system, the old, what we called civilisation, is dying, d isintegrating, that is creating space and  creating an opening for the birthing and emergence of the new, the creation of fundamentally  new institutions, of governance, of business, of education, of science, of religion, from the  bottom up, out of the commu nity. And they need to recognise that most of what they are learning
  in their education, in their formal education, is from the past, and is attuned to maintaining the  institutions that are the fundamental problem that's leading us to self - extinction.  And that they have to understand those institutions and understand how they operate. But their  goal is not to become powerful leaders in those institutions, it is to transform them. Wow. How  do they do that? I don't know, but it's what that generation need s to figure out. So they need to  be learning in ways that are not supported by their educational institutions, which partially  means, instead of just sitting in class taking notes on what they're told, they need to be  challenging that system, they have to   be asking deeper questions.  Essentially, the students and the faculty need to be working together, finding the new answers.  So part of this is transforming the institutions of education themselves. But it also means, you  know, that it's incredibly important for the students to interc onnect, not just through their cell  phones, but   through   learning to   work together, learning together, engaging with their  communities together to create something wholly new in the human experience.  But that draws from all of our sources of knowledge, from traditional knowledge, from religious  institutions, our spiritual insights, but particularly from the frontiers of the biological and  environmental sciences, ecological sciences.  Rohan Hazell:  As   Professor   Korten   suggests,   top - down   transformation   of   multilateral   institutions   and  multinational companies, as well as bottom - up changes that challenge the status quo in areas  like education and community development, are needed if we are to create a m ore equitable and  sustainable economy.

Reimagining Sustainability 

### keyTakeaway
Professor Jeffrey Sachs discussed key aspects of reimagining sustainability, emphasising the need for national action, business alignment, and individual learning.Companies should align their business models with global commitments like the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Biodiversity Convention.Governments should focus on sustainable development planning, including universal education, health coverage, and energy transformation, rather than short-term political narratives.Professor Sachs emphasises the need for multilateralism and cooperation among major powers, especially in times of war and global tension.Individual mindset shifts are vital to creating a sustainable future, which is why Professor Sachs advocates lifelong learning in scientific, technological, and ethical knowledge areas.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Reimagining Sustainability  Elaine Fernandez :  The four big myths of sustainability covered in the last two chapters should make it clear that  shifting towards more sustainable systems is no small task.  In   this chapter   you’ll hear from Professor   Jeffrey Sachs on   how we   can   reimagine  sustainability, commit to lifelong learning in this area, and shift our governance and economic  systems in the right direction.  Professor Jeffrey Sachs:  At the global level, global consciousness level. We really need to understand and honour the  principle that all of humanity is equal, has rights to dignity, like the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights says, has the aspirations for economic   wellbeing , wants peace, and that this is  a common feature of a common humanity. Strangely, that's hard to achieve. So my efforts at  a personal level are to support the UN in its mission, to help update the UN to realities of 21st  century finance, economy and techno logy.  To say to the major powers, no, even though you're powerful, you can't write the rules  yourself. We need multilateralism. This is all a very big challenge, and it's really being  challenged at this moment with war and tensions among the major powers that I   find  unacceptable. Given the stakes of humanity, we need a cooperative approach under the UN  framework. When it comes to the national level, my advice is look at the goals that the whole  world has agreed to, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Cli mate Agreement, the  biodiversity convention and so forth, and then ask the question, okay, what should we in  Pakistan or Nigeria or China or South Africa or Russia or the United States do to achieve what  we have said is important for all the world? And tha t comes to planning, to understanding, to  setting out a framework and a pathway to understanding how national budgets should be  oriented to support these goals that we've set.  And for businesses to ask the question, how can we as a business, align with the objective,  for example, of creating a   zero - carbon   energy system by mid century? A very practical,  extremely important question. A lot of this requires planning at the national level or at the  company level, because companies plan a lot, or the successful ones do, and they need to  plan how to align with t he world that is absolutely urgently in need of sustainable  development. And one way or another, too late or on time, is going to orient in that direction.
  So that is not only a mindset change, but a very operational change. And I would say in Nigeria  or Pakistan or the United States, is the national government setting forward plans on how to  achieve universal quality education, how to achieve universal healt h coverage,   how to achieve  the energy transformation? I'll give you a hint. The answer is not very often, but that is the  job of the government. The job of government is not politicians spinning stories on a daily  news cycle the job of government is creating a path to   sustainable development for our  societies.  The question of economic needs and wants is a   long - standing   discussion that goes back well  over 2000 years. Because you find in the ancient wisdom, this discussion, that there's a big  difference between greed, which is the desire to accumulate more and more wealth, and  need, which is what we need for our   wellbeing . And of course, we have material needs. We  need food, we need safe water, we need shelter, we need educational opportunities, we need  social protection in the event of illness. We need institutions that help, especially with an  ageing population.  Now, in 1948, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, economic rights were identified.  These economic rights could be considered to be these needs. The economic rights are things  that are so important for human dignity and well - being that everybody s hould have them.  And what is identified in the universal declaration are rights or needs for food, shelter,  social protection, education, health care, and a standard of living compatible with human  dignity. These are spelled out clearly.  Scholars and sages going back to Aristotle. The teachings of Jesus, the teachings of Bhagavad  Gita, the teachings of the Quran, make this important distinction. And the great wisdom  tradition say, if you just chase your wants, you'll end up very unhappy, b y the way we really  need to take on this point in a very deep way. Gandhi is often quoted, the world is big enough  to meet everybody's needs, but not everybody's greed.  When Aristotle, more than 2300 years ago, took up the question of what will make a good  society, he argued that knowledge was fundamental, that the good life doesn't come by itself.  It comes through knowledge, through understanding. And he identified three   kinds of  knowledge that I think are very helpful for us today. Episteme was the Greek term for what  we call scientific knowledge. Techne is the greek term, for what we now would call  engineering or technology, understanding and ethics, which is the knowle dge of what  Aristotle called practical wisdom, the ability to choose properly in life. So he identified the  range of knowledge that is needed, scientific, technical and ethical knowledge.  It's a good starting point for us. When the sustainable development goals were adopted, the  governments wisely noted that in order to achieve sustainable development, everybody  needed to understand the basis of sustainable development. So they put in a tar get, target  4.7 under SDG 4. SDG 4 is quality education for all. Target 4.7 is to understand the challenges  of sustainable development.
  So it's back to Aristotle's three divisions of knowledge –   understand the science of climate  change, for example; understand the basics of the technological transformation to a zero  carbon energy system. And understand the practical wisdom that we need for   cooperation  within our societies and across societies in order to cooperate properly to achieve these goals.  Now target 4.7 says everybody needs to be a learner. Of course children in school, but what  about the rest of us adults?  Lifelong learning, because we need a lot of tooling and retooling. The technological advances  are coming so fast that the world's really being reshaped faster than we can even understand  how it's being reshaped. And these technologies often get out of cont rol.  Elaine Fernandez:  Professor Sachs has made it clear that our multilateral and national governance systems  should be leveraged to achieve socioeconomic   wellbeing , peace and dignity. After all, it is the  government's responsibility to develop and implement plans and frameworks to achieve  sustainable development, such as universal education, health coverage and an energy  transformation. He also spoke to the need for   businesses to align with sustainability  objectives, which will require mindset, behavioural and operational shifts within companies.  Importantly, these changes can be made a reality by each of us, which is why he stressed the  importance of shifting away f rom a culture of overconsumption.  As Professor Sachs concluded, it is incumbent on each of us to continue learning about the  issues that impact the world, our countries, our organisations and our communities if we are  to successfully redesign our societies for the betterment of people and   planet. Now that  you've completed this core module, you can explore the rest of the series on deconstructing  and reimagining sustainability.

What is the Purpose of the State in the 21st Century?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Chandran Nair shared that while economic growth is important, it is not the primary purpose of governance. Rather, good governance should aim to lay the foundation for an equitable society and sustainable prosperity. The primary role of governments should be governance itself, aimed at creating stable and equitable societies.Good governance is a prerequisite for a healthy economy. Governments must create conditions that prevent economic activities from disrupting societal harmony or capturing state institutions. There are three Principal Objectives of the State: Protecting public goods, providing access to basic rights, and ensuring prosperity within resource constraints.

  TRANSCRIPT  What is the Purpose of the State in the 21st Century?  Elaine Fernandez:  What is the purpose of the State? To enable rule of law? To help the economy grow?  The purpose of the State might seem like a simple question, but the responsibilities of  governments are so far - reaching that answering this question can be a challenge.  That’s why GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair, will make the case that the purpose of the state is  to lay the foundation for societal wellbeing and shared prosperity, with three principal objectives.  Chandran Nair:  This is a good question about whether the primary role of the government is to stimulate  economic growth. And it's a contemporary view that has been mainstreamed over the last 60 - 70  years, as we have adopted more neoliberal ideas about economics and develo pment. But I  suggest to all of you to think about this very differently, given what you have picked up about the  challenges of the key drivers of the 21st century.  You govern so that you create a stable society. There is social equity and social balance so that  everybody has equal access. That doesn't mean some socialist utopia. And then you have to have  what I would call, the need for economic activity to create the   goods and services that people  need. An economy is essentially the ability to organise the resources in ways that are distributed  through means which all people have access, and do not create distortions in ways that would  disrupt a harmonious society.  So govern first, in order to create a stable society that is equitable. And to do that, you need to  have economic activity. But economic activity that does not create disparities, which allow for  disharmony, or economic activities that essentially disrupt   governance systems, so that economic  actors do not capture the institutions of the state, and that's the role of the government. We see  it throughout the world. When governance systems fail and the government itself, it's forgotten  in its obligations to go vern family, to create a good social environment, then you can't have a  good economy either, because there are so much distortions, et cetera.
  So we need to understand that even to have a good economy, then the government has to create  the conditions, the preconditions for that. So you can't have a good economy if you don't have a  good education system, because you don't have a labour pool. You c an't have a good economy if  you do not have a good rule of law, where contracts can be negotiated, where people feel that  contracts have been broken. You can't have a good economy if there's no security. And that's the  fundamentals.  So I just want to make the point that good governance is essentially a prerequisite to create an  economy. And then the economy starts to thrive, because the government then doesn't shackle  the economic activity of the participants of the economy. But it do es have to create the condition  so that economic actors don't hijack social conditions, do not disrupt things in ways that create  externalities that have negative impacts on populations, nor do they capture the state.  So given all of that, as I said, you start with governance. That's the main obligation of the state,  governance, to create social conditions that are fair, in which members of the public, the society,  have an equal access. There's no perfect world, but you   have to create it. That's the obligation.  It's hard work.  The objectives are threefold. The first is to protect common and public goods, and I'll try and  define what I mean by common and public goods. Then it is to provide the access to what I call  the basic rights to life. And there are six of them, which we wil l outline. And finally, to make sure  that it allows societies to prosper. And prosper is not just simply the creation of wealth.  Prosperity is going to have to be redefined by notions such as equal access, basic rights to live,  certain freedoms, etc., the understanding of a shared prosperity. But to understand that we have  to have a prosperity within very hard resource constraints.  Elaine Fernandez:  It is all too easy to assume that the role of the government is to help the economy thrive. But this  is just one aspect of the State’s responsibilities. After all, economic growth does not guarantee  social stability or welfare. These need to be provided f or, first and foremost.  Nurturing healthy societies and driving economic growth requires good governance, which  underpins the three principal responsibilities of the State: protecting public and common goods,  providing the basic rights to life, and ensuring moderate prosperity fo r all.

State’s Role: Synergising Sustainability with Profitability and Public Support

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the indispensable role that States must play in furthering sustainable development by incentivising market involvement and garnering public support.The onus is on States to steer the private sector to pursue sustainable development with legislation that regulates their operations according to sustainable development practices, while also facilitating a profitable environment to incentivise business involvement. It’s the duty of States to persuade their citizenry to willingly contribute more to sustainable development through increased taxes, and effectively communicate that doing so is ultimately in their best interests. States are then obligated to ensure these funds are spent responsibly.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  State’s Role: Synergising Sustainability with  Profitability and Public Support  Elaine Fernandez:  The book "Earth for All", co - authored by Professor Emeritus of Climate Strategy at the BI  Norwegian Business School, Jorgen Randers, outlines five key areas where humanity must  focus to address the decline of global wellbeing.  This begs the question: If the steps we need to take are so obvious, why has there been so  little progress? Professor Randers will share more about what he believes to be the root  causes of inaction, market profitability and public support, explaining the   crucial role that  governments should play in overcoming these bottlenecks.  Professor Jorgen Randers:  The main reason why progress is so slow on these five totally obvious long - standing ambitions  is that these five actions are not profitable from the investor point of view. So if you have an  unguided market, an uncontrolled market, the capital will not flo w into those five things  because there are more profitable opportunities elsewhere.  It is actually my very broad experience from multinational corporations being on the  sustainability board of such for 15 or 20 years. When you sit in a big corporation, there are  investment opportunities around and you sort them of course, according to wha t gives the  highest return to yourself or to the shareholder. That's in many countries your legal obligation  actually to choose those investment projects that gives the highest return to the owner. And  if you talk to most owners, be they pension funds or b e they individuals or be they stinking  rich individual persons, all of them are actually interested in the highest return rather than  some good. So that is the simple reason why so little happens.  The basic idea is that you need to twist the market, influence the market, regulate the market,  ban things, pay subsidies in order to shift the flow of capital into those five things, that’s the  5 Turnarounds. Thirty years ago, the idea of the carbon price   entered the picture. And one  simply said that if we force companies to pay for the CO2 they emit, then at least they will  shift to towards sun and wind, et cetera.  We are now finally in Europe after 30 years, gotten to the point where the carbon price is high  enough that it actually starts to make an electric car competitive with a fossil car. And we
  have also gotten so far in the softening of the car industry that some of them start  understanding that Elon Musk was right, that it's actually possible to make more money on  electric cars in the long - term future than continuing on the fossil cars. But it' s a slow process.  Let's take one concrete example just to make it simpler to understand. The most important  challenge from a Northern point of view, which is the climate challenge, stopped using coal,  oil and gas and just built windmills and solar panels and   ocean   going   wind and biomass - based  heat, et cetera. Why haven't we done all of those things? It is, of course, because solar  electricity has been very much more expensive than gas - fired utilities and so has windmills.  So that is the reason.  And that points to the role of government in all of this. If everyone agreed that the problem  is that these things are too costly and everyone agreed that we need to do them anyway, the  simple way is, of course, to subsidise. You just ask the government to   subsidise the  introduction of sun, subsidise the introduction of wind, subsidise the building of CCS plants  on gas - fired utilities, subsidising the production of green and blue hydrogen, so that these  things become profitable from the investor point of vi ew.  I was the chair of the Royal Norwegian Commission in 2006, where we present the perfect  plan for how Norway could cut its greenhouse gas emissions by essentially all, by 2050, which  is in Norway, at our affluence levels, a percent at most of the income of   people. We would  need to increase taxes, get it to the government in order to implement all the subsidies  necessary in order to get us changed. And of course, there is absolutely no support for that  idea of the 1% tax increase in the Norwegian population,   which is, for the time being, the  richest one on the surface of the earth.  In order to maintain trust, you need to deliver results. The only way in which you can maintain  a governmental trust is by making sure that wellbeing goes up. How do you do this in the rich  world? Where do you get the money? The only way to get the money i s to increase taxes or  to borrow the money. But we are already at the borrowing ceiling in most countries, so it is  to increase taxes.  So in other words, what you need to do in order to move in the Western world is to convince  the people to accept tax increases that are earmarked for green purposes. This is very hard  and I would say close to impossible until COVID, because COVID was the f irst time when  governments started deciding to do something which is not profitable, where the bottleneck  is namely the role of government, and how do we manage to get popular support, voter  support, for those totally trivial things that needs to be done i n order to make it profitable, to  do those five things that needs to be done in order to save the world.  Elaine Fernandez:
  The lack of profitability in sustainable development is a major obstacle to achieving the five  turnarounds. Understandably, if left to its own devices, the private sector will likely act in the  best interest of shareholders and focus on the bottom line. As   Professor Randers highlights,  this is where governments must step in to incentivise action.  For example, given the high cost of scalable green energy systems, governments should co -  invest and subsidise to lower the barriers to entry as most governments tend to run budget  deficits. Where will these funds come from? The obvious answer would be taxe s. However,  this leads to another obstacle on the path to sustainable development, public support and  the ability of a government to gain buy - in from its citizens and businesses for higher taxation  to improve collective wellbeing.

International Concerns Surrounding Globalisation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the complex interplay of economic, cultural, and environmental factors shaping international concerns regarding globalisation.Globalisation continues to evolve and manifest differently over time. The process has seen a peak in the last few decades, but countries are witnessing a backlash against it, even from Western nations that were once its staunch supporters.The backlash against globalisation is driven by various concerns. Economically, there is fear of stagnation, income inequality, and corporate dominance both in advanced and developing nations. Culturally, there's apprehension about the rapid movement of people and its impact on societal norms and values.Long-held assumptions about globalisation, such as the belief that more globalisation is the solution to national challenges, are being challenged. Governments and businesses are being prompted to rethink their approaches to globalisation, leading to trade wars, tariffs, and protectionist measures

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  International Concerns Surrounding Globalisation  Rohan Hazell:  Globalisation is facing a turning point. Although the world is more connected than ever through  trade, international bodies, and culture, many governments and businesses have concerns over  the impacts of globalisation in their countries.  You’ll get an insight into these concerns from Chandran Nair, Founder and Chairman of GIFT.ed.  Chandran Nair:  So, as we speak about the pros and cons of globalisation, that globalisation cannot be reversed.  It's unstoppable. But we also accept that globalisation will continue to morph and change in  different ways. It is interesting to know that as it has peaked in a way over the last 30 - 40 years,  and as countries have joined the sort of mainstream globalisation narrative, all the advantages  that I spoke about earlier, there has been now a recurring sort of backlash against globalisation.  And interestingly, some of this backlash has come from Western countries, which were the  strongest advocates of globalisation. Western countries are now unsure about losing political  and economic authority and autonomy to the rest of the world. The rest, meaning the large  economies of the developing world - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Brazil and  things like that and countries like those.  So, there's a fear amongst the West that the rules of globalisation, many of which were  essentially constructed by the West, no longer protect them from the inevitable rise of the  others. And thus, there has been a backlash, the closing of borders, trade interfering in trade  agreements, et cetera.  Trade wars and tariffs are becoming normal policy again. As the United States has become  worried about the rise of China and the trade deficit, it has imposed trade wars and tariffs on  China. And many countries are using these sorts of things to essentially close their borders to  certain trades and certain commercial arrangements that they see do not benefit them.  
Then there's also the fear of the economic stagnation, income inequality, and corporate power  that people around the world are fearing. This is not just in developing countries. In the more  advanced countries, even in the United States, there's much anger and resentment towards  what they see as outsized corporate power, the ability for corporations to influence outcomes in  so many ways, the rise of monopolies, and of course, income inequalities.  In the developing countries, there is fear that due to globalisation, there is economic stagnation  because the countries are exposed to essentially the vulnerabilities of global pricing regimes,  which they have no control of locally. And those are all part of the tensions that people are  feeling throughout the world.  Others are uneasy with the cultural changes and the mass movement of people. People are  worried that their cultures and their societies are being changed as they open up too quickly. A  good example would be a country like Japan, which has a very unique culture if you've ever  been to Japan. And which is thus, on one hand, in need of labour inputs because it's an ageing  society. But yet Japan is very worried about how its culture will change?. And one has the  sympathetic and understanding of this. In other countries, it has been both the fear of jobs  being taken in the UK, and also the fear of essentially the cultural impacts of mass migration of  people from areas like from regions like Africa and the Middle East.  And finally, there's a growing awareness of the connection between economic growth and  pollution. A whole generation is now becoming aware that our unchecked economic growth  does result in irreversible damage to ecosystems. It does pollute, it does create resource  depletion   and   has environmental threats that affect our lives and our health. And that  awareness is essentially part of the backlash towards globalisation.  You can't let anybody come into your country. You can't just trade all your resources. You can't  let your people just work at low wages, just to attract or foreign direct investments. These are  questions that didn't exist maybe 25 years ago in the profound ways that they are being asked  by citizens around the world.  And this is not just questions that are being asked in developing countries. They're also being  asked in the most developed countries of the world. So, the question really is what sort of  globalisation do we need to have and how do we manage the way we globalise? And have we  learnt   lessons   from   the pandemic that allow us to design and manage a new form of  globalisation, given that it's unstoppable anyway?  Another assumption of globalisation or what it meant was that the solution to the problems of  globalisation is more globalisation. If you had a problem in terms of not reaching certain goals  with globalisation, what you needed to do was have more globalisation. In reality, there was  very little recognition that some aspects of globalisation did not bring benefits equally and had  to be essentially altered to essentially deliver on more equitable outcomes for the majority. And  
there was a belief that unintended consequences can be dealt with later. This too is now seen as  a fallacy.  And finally, there was that view that everything should be borderless, that we should live in a  world in which there should be no borders, and perhaps we should not even have passports,  and that sovereignty was a hindrance.  What we've seen now in the last few years is that even the strongest advocates of globalisation,  like the United States, Europe, et cetera, have retreated from those positions. They want  borders. Sovereignty is very important, and other parts of the world have looked upon these  and understood that the thinking is beginning to change, and how do they adapt to that?  So, what kind of world do we want? What kind of globalisation do we desire? How do we  rethink all of this, is fundamentally part of the unlearning.  Rohan Hazell:  Long-held assumptions about globalisation are shifting due to the impacts – both positive and  negative – it is having on countries around the world.  From economic stagnation to environmental issues and fears surrounding cultural dilution,  these impacts are prompting governments and businesses to re-evaluate the way globalisation  is enacted.

The Common Agenda: The Role of Government and Business in the Social Contract   

### keyTakeaway
This chapter explored the social contract highlighted in the UN Common Agenda Summit, which addresses labour market vulnerabilities, climate action, and the need for equitable social protection and inclusion.Employment is one of the most important aspects of a community’s welfare, which is why it should be positioned at the heart of the social contract.Over 75% of the world's people have little or no social protection. Governments must therefore push legislation for workers' rights, environmental protection, and equitable wealth distribution.The complexities of the market economy mean governments should legislate foundational justice to balance competition and prevent exploitation and corruption.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Common Agenda: The Role of Government and  Business in the Social Contract  Rohan Hazell :  The social contract is an implicit agreement among different stakeholders in society to  cooperate for mutual benefit.  Sharan Burrow, former General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation,  argues that the social contract is in need of a renewal, so that governments and businesses  can take strategic decisions to provide better conditions for workers, manag e environmental  resources more sustainably, and improve community welfare.  Sharan Burrow:  The social contract that the UN Secretary General has referenced at the heart of the Common  Agenda Summit scheduled for 2025; this is a moment of optimism, really. That summit brings  together the aspirations of people, the consultation process has been and   will continue to be  vast. You really have to congratulate Secretary General Guterres on this question.  In the lead up to that because of the vulnerabilities in the labour market, and of course, the  questions around just transition and the urgency of climate action, and no one is tougher on  that question than Guterres himself. But he's also set up a global   accelerator for jobs and  social protection for just transitions. So, acknowledging that at the heart of just transition has  to be jobs, and we have to have the resilience of social protection for everybody.  It is a scandal globally that more than 75% of the world's people have little or no social  protection, you know, yet our economies are four, six, seven times wealthier than they were  just a few decades ago in GDP terms. So again, it comes back to the distr ibution question and  how we build in shared prosperity to the economic model.  But the social contract for us is a way of framing all these ambitions. Because at the heart of  decent work is fundamental rights. The right to freedom of association, to be able to have a  collective voice for workers to bargain collectively with your empl oyers. And now, to have   a  safe work environment has been the latest fundamental right added just last year.  Occupational health and safety.
  It is about jobs. Climate friendly jobs that require a just transition frame. There is no  impediment to us returning to policies, to our central banks returning to policies, to our  governments returning to policies of full employment.  We didn't ever really construct a free market that was designed to actually denude  employment, and yet that's what the outcome has been. So that centrality is important.  It's also about universal social protection and equality. Besides income inequality, if you look  at inequality for women, migrant workers, minority groups, and young people in the world of  work today across the income spectrum   -   we can do better.  Women lost some $800 billion during the pandemic and they were one of the most vulnerable  groups. It’s not just a loss to individuals and families, but a loss to nations. That's about the  GDP of some combined 95, 96 countries, and that's massive. So on eve ry indicator, progress  for women is stalled, and we need to reconsider that notion of equality and inclusion. Of  course, it does mean an inclusive future that is about the common security for people  everywhere.  We've got more conflicts in the world today. The military spends greater than   post - World   War  II, Europe's been rocked by the invasion of Russia into Ukraine. They genuinely set itself up as  a peace project with an ambition that war will never again be on their doorstep, and we've  seen the impact of that conflict due to the impact of rising en ergy and food spikes in prices  on everybody.  If we have a notion that a social contract means governments and employers have a  responsibility for people, first of all in the world of work, from our perspective, but also more  broadly from a social protection   point of view, from   a community development , a  development model that works for people. And of course, the SDGs still carry the frameworks  for some of that justice, but we tend to get distracted from what it was that people said the  Sustainable Development Goals should deliver. So, we are running w ay   behind,   and we just  have to start running faster and faster to catch up.  Even if you go back, whether it's to the more positive or the negative aspects of a market  economy, whether it was the establishment of the WTO, to the original agreements, and even  indeed the Marrakesh   -   opening paragraph talks about a world where you do   not leave people  behind. Different language to that, but nevertheless, it's there.  The Bretton Woods was set up to stabilise and develop economies, to provide development  models that allowed for inclusion. And that means indeed employment amongst other  indicators. But many central banks actually were charged by the government when they w ere  increasingly rendered independent within a charter or a legislative framework. They were  charged with the mandate for employment.
  However, it's got lost in the mix because the market economy is not dependent on  government's abdicating from their responsibility to legislate the foundation. Otherwise, we  have the laws of the jungle. And ironically, business is very good at arguing, soc ialisation of  its losses, but privatisation of its profits.  Now that's hardly a free market, and we can look at that and look at the constraints on  competition policy today. I've always had this respect for competition policy and pushed  against it where it wanted to stop workers supporting each other to actually ac cumulate a  powerful enough voice to get some social and economic justice from the deliverables of  business.  But nevertheless, in my world, I grew up with it as a religion. We might have chafed around  some of the edges, but people accepted that competition kept you from the worst excesses  of monopolies and therefore price setting corruption or oligopsonies, whate ver terms you  want to use. But it does seem to me that we conflate a market economy with “Let the market  do what it wants”, rather than saying; “Well, a market economy has to be founded on some  kind of justice.” When governments abdicated their responsibil ity to legislate for workers'  rights, for decent work, for distribution, when they failed to build social protection systems  from the wealth that's been delivered from business and from taxes. Because remember,  workers pay more taxes than corporations, by   and large in every country.  So, we really do have to rethink what is that build that allows a fairly competitive business  model with a model that's founded on legislative commitments to workers, to the  environment, to communities, so that corruption is curtailed, but so too is exploi tation.  Rohan Hazell:  At the heart of a just transition must be jobs and social protection for all. The social contract  is a way of framing all these ambitions, with a focus on decent work, fundamental rights,  universal social protection, equality, and inclusion.  Governments therefore have a responsibility to create regulations that are founded on  justice and commitments to workers, the environment, and communities, to curb  corruption and exploitation, and to encourage healthy competition in business.

Serving the Underserved: Lessons from Microinsurance

### keyTakeaway
By exploring underserved markets, you can unlock opportunities for both business expansion and improved conditions for these communities.By prioritising customer-centric innovation, you will be able to cater your services to the unique needs of your customers, leading to successful product buy-in and improved brand loyalty.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Serving the   U nderserved: Lessons from Microinsurance  Rohan Hazell:  This case study explores the business challenge of designing services for new customer  segments, particularly underserved low - income communities who make up the global  majority.  Many   companies   fail   to   recognise   that   serving   this   segment   holds   major   business  opportunities. Engaging with these communities expands the market, fuels brand recognition,  and encourages innovative business strategies that benefit the whole organisation.  Developing commercially viable ways to serve the underserved also   signals a commitment to  redefining how your business creates social value.  To illustrate this, we'll use microinsurance as an example. The first known insurance initiatives  began as far back as the 1300s, but the first microinsurance products only arose as recently  as the 1990s.  Insurance premiums can be prohibitively expensive for many people, making it challenging  for them to access the coverage they need.  Microinsurance is more affordable, tailored for low - income individuals through simplified  policies for specific needs, and with lower coverage limits.  It can help alleviate poverty, promote community resilience, empower families through  financial inclusion, and even grow a sense of solidarity and shared responsibility within  communities.  For example, in a rural farming community, each farmer would pay a nominal premium, and  the insurance company provides compensation to help them recover losses in the event of a  poor harvest due to weather or pests. This helps smallholder farmers manage ri sks and secure  their livelihoods, contributing to their financial stability and food security.  Since its inception, microinsurance has taken on many different forms, and is especially  relevant in today's world. Why? Because the consumer base is rapidly growing in many lower -  income countries, where potential buyers now have the technology, awareness,   and appetite  to utilise appropriately priced services like microinsurance.
  The social benefits of microinsurance are part of the reason it is rapidly becoming a vibrant  and competitive service, with the global market reaching almost 80 billion dollars in   2021 and  expected to grow by nearly 7% year on year for the foreseeable future.  In this case study, we'll focus on two key business challenges that industries around the world  are facing, using solutions from microinsurance as examples of how to think about addressing  them.  First,   we   will   explore how to identify channels that enable access to rising consumer  segments. Second, we'll look at how to tailor services for these customers in a way that places  them at the centre of the design process.  The first major business challenge facing the microinsurance sector is gaining access to  underserved communities in the first place.  Overcoming this hurdle requires raising awareness about the benefits of the service, and  helping communities see the value it can bring to them for the long term.  Globally, companies have managed this by incorporating microinsurance options into the  financial services people already use. For example, by integrating microinsurance into  retirement savings plans.  These existing savings plans, provided by the government or employers, are much more  widespread. By acting as an add - on to this service, microinsurance providers can connect with  customers through a trustworthy channel that already encourages them to think   about the  future. This makes it easier for them to consider investing their money in other ways.  It also helps customers secure coverage for specific risks. without significant additional costs,  building both retirement savings and insurance protection concurrently.  An example of this can be found in Malaysia, through a microinsurance scheme called i -  Lindung, offered by the Employees Provident Fund, or EPF. The EPF is a government - managed  retirement savings fund, and i - Lindung provides life insurance coverage and crit ical illness  benefits without requiring medical examination.  The premium is deducted from customer's EPF account, and in the case of death or critical  illness, beneficiaries receive a lump - sum payment.  i - Lindung aims to extend insurance protection to   low - income   earners and those with limited  access to traditional insurance, offering financial security during difficult times. In total, there  are five large insurance providers that leverage EPF's in - person and online presence to deliver  tailored microinsurance pro ducts.  We know that accessing underserved communities, or segments that are rising in socio  economic status, can be a serious challenge. The lesson here is that associating your service
  with trusted channels will allow you to expand your brand awareness, gaining future  customers and creating positive social impact in the process.  The second   challenge is creating new services for customers that companies aren't  traditionally familiar with.  The microinsurance example is a success story of how this can be done. As an example, let's  look at the Novadeci Health Care Program, or NHCP, based in the Philippines.  This microinsurance company began as a clinic looking to improve the quality and quantity of  their healthcare   services. Now, they have successfully rolled out microinsurance for  healthcare to thousands of informal workers in Quezon City, who are excluded f rom private  and state - led healthcare.  To better understand the health care needs of informal workers, NHCP examined the medical  services and products they accessed most and how they used emergency loans for healthcare.  Based on these findings, NHCP identified that informal workers wanted a "one - stop - shop"  clinic where they could have medical checkups and their laboratory tests done, and where  they could easily purchase medicines. These workers also wanted a system that w ould free  them from the complicated financial procedures involved in traditional health insurance.  In response to these findings, NHCP designed its clinics to match its customer's needs. This  helped gain the trust of the community and enabled it to market a tailored microinsurance  service that was targeted through specifically designed clinics, affordab le, at 3 to 15 dollars a  year and simple with transparent payment and claiming processes.  In this way, NHCP has managed to simultaneously improve the lives of thousands of Quezon  City's   city   residents, while also growing as a successful business increasing its size by a factor  of 30 in just 10 years.  When faced with an unfamiliar and underserved customer segment in addition to gaining  their trust, deeply understanding their needs first is a vital prerequisite for creating innovative  products and services.  Microinsurance plays a critical role in promoting financial inclusion. By bringing insurance  services to underserved and marginalised populations, it enables them to participate more  fully in the formal financial system and improve their quality of life. I t helps bridge the  insurance gap and reduces disparities in financial protection across different socioeconomic  groups.  By integrating microinsurance within existing financial channels, like retirement savings plans,  innovative insurance providers have been able to penetrate a market that otherwise remains  out of reach.
  Importantly, once this access is achieved, the service has to place the new customer segment  at the centre of product design   -   after all, each segment has its own unique context and needs.  Ultimately, recent developments in microinsurance remind us that designing services for new  customer segments, particularly underserved communities, can present major business  opportunities. Importantly, successful microinsurance companies demonstrate comm itment  to a vital aspect of redesigning society: balancing both commercial and social value creation.

Global Sustainability Challenges: Part 1

### keyTakeaway
Dr Jane Goodall provided her expert insight on the major sustainability challenges of our time, highlighting their complexity and interconnected nature.Existential threats like climate change and biodiversity loss are exacerbated by industrial systems inherent in modern agriculture, fishing, and the production of goods.Countries need to address corruption and bottom-up issues like overconsumption. Without effective management of these challenges, improving our industrial systems will be extremely difficult.Sustainability challenges may be global, but they do not impact everyone equally. For this reason, it is important to address issues like poverty in tandem with environmental protection measures.

  TRANSCRIPT  Global Sustainability Challenges: Part 1  Rohan Hazell:  In the last chapter, we explored the origins of this thing we call sustainability. Building on this  understanding, we'll now look at the major sustainability challenges we face with two of the  world's leading voices on the topic: Dr. Jane Goodall, founder   of the Jane Goodall Institute  and UN Messenger of Peace, and Professor Jeffrey Sachs, President of the UN Sustainable  Development Solutions Network.  In   this   chapter,   Dr.   Goodall   introduces   the   global   sustainability   challenges   she   has  encountered across her lifetime of work in promoting a better relationship between people  and the planet.  Dr. Jane Goodall:  I think the important thing is to say that right now, the world is a pretty grim and bleak place,  environmentally as well of course, as socially and politically. And right now, we face two major  threats, existential threats, and that's climate change and t he loss of biodiversity.  Most people concentrate on climate change, but it's irreversibly linked with the loss of plant  and animal species. So climate change, of course, as most people know now, is due to the so -  called greenhouse gases that blanket the surface of the globe and tra p the heat of the sun.  And that's led to these sometimes terrifying changes in weather patterns around the world.  The more and worse storms, hurricanes, typhoons, the more and worse flooding and heat  waves and droughts and wildfires.  Then another problem is industrial agriculture, with its reliance on pesticides and herbicides,  which are actually killing the soil, and its artificial fertiliser, which is causing tremendous  problems as it washed down into the rivers, the lakes, and the o cean, where the phosphorus  is causing dead zones and massive loss of life.  And then commercial animal agriculture, the factory farms, huge areas cleared to feed these  billions of animals. Masses of fossil fuel used to get the grain to the animals, the animals to  the abattoir, the meat to the table. They produce an awful lot of me thane in their digestion.  And then, in addition, antibiotics are typically used just to keep them alive so that the bacteria
  build up resistance and people are getting sick, and antibiotics don't work. It's leading to the  superbugs, which is killing many people, even in hospitals.  So then we get commercial fishing. We get the long lines and the drift nets. We get the bottom  dredging, which is destroying the seabed, the corals, and everything else, and overfishing.  And then we've got disease, which comes from our disrespect of the na tural world.  And then finally, there's corruption. And that has a huge role in allowing many of these things  to actually happen. People, politicians, and businesses are paid off to allow unethical  procedures. We're in a mess. And it's affecting just about everyone, esp ecially anyone living  in those areas especially affected in the Global South. Then there's poverty, often not taken  into consideration.  But if you're very poor and you're living in some kind of wilderness, you're going to destroy  the environment in order to survive. Let me take for example, Gombe Stream National Park.  In 1960, it was part of a great forest belt. By the late 1980s, it was a   tiny island of forest and  all the hills around were bare. More people living there than the land could support. Too poor  to buy food elsewhere, struggling to survive. Cutting down the trees to make money from  charcoal or timber or to make more land to gro w more food. And that's when it hit me. If we  don't help these people, these local communities find ways of living without destroying the  environment, we can't save chimpanzees, forests or anything else, but we need to alleviate  poverty.  And then there's the unsustainable lifestyle of so many of us. And I include myself, I have far  more than I need. And some people take this to   excess,   and they have way, way more than  they could ever possibly need. And this is something that somehow we have to change.  Rohan Hazell:  Dr. Goodall has highlighted the major sustainability challenges as she sees them, starting with  climate change and biodiversity loss, which are made worse by economic activities from  industrial agriculture to overconsumption. Importantly, she pointed out t hat these issues are  not independent from socioeconomic factors that impact us every day. For example, she  stressed that only by alleviating poverty can we get communities around the world to think  of sustainability, and not just meeting their basic needs.  In the next chapter, we'll hear from Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who gives us his view on global  sustainability challenges from the perspective of development, economics and governance.

Local Solutions: Asia

### keyTakeaway
We learned how mitigation and adaptation strategies have been successfully implemented in Asia while being tailored to suit local contexts.Effective disaster preparedness, through forecasting systems or built infrastructure, can help save countless lives, especially in regions prone to increasingly frequent extreme weather events.A state with strong institutions is able to encourage collaboration with the private sector and civil society organisations, to further adaptation and mitigation strategies.The success of nations like China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Vietnam in "going green" lies in their ability to adopt modern economic practices while still maintaining their culture and identity.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Local Solutions: Asia  Elaine Fernandez:  We can be certain that the world needs strategies to mitigate and adapt to the sustainability  challenges of the 21st century.  But given how varied human societies are in terms of their demographics, cultures, governance  systems, and circumstances: the way these strategies are implemented must also vary.  Now, let's hear about some real-world examples of how countries in Asia were able to  successfully   implement   mitigation   and   adaptation   strategies   tailored   to   their   unique  circumstances.  To explore these examples further, you’ll hear from Erik Solheim, former Executive Director of  the United Nations Environment Program.  Erik Solheim:  I mean, the nation we should learn from the very beginning was the first nonwhite nation which  developed - it was Japan. Japan in the 1870s, as we all know, had a major revolution, which was  to adapt all the technologies and some of the industrial practices of the West, but integrated  into Japan. And no one thinks Japan is not Japan. And that Japan is like the West. Japan has a  very, very strong culture, but they have adopted the western modern practices of economy to  strengthen their nation.  That is the pattern, which later was followed by South Korea, by Singapore, by China, and now  by Vietnam, by India. India will remain Indian but modern. Vietnam will remain Vietnamese but  modern.  Let figures speak for themselves. In China last year it produced 82% of all solar panels in the  world, and 70% of electric batteries in the world. And the rest, by the way, are mainly made in  South Korea.  
If you buy an American car, say Tesla, yes, the car is designed in California, but the battery in all  likelihood is Chinese. And the battery is 50% of the value of the car. Then 80% of all new  hydropower in the world came from China, 60% on new solar, 60% on new offshore wind.  Basically, whatever technology you can mention for the green shift, China is in the lead. Why?  For two reasons, I believe. First, the political leadership of China took the message from the  people. Message from the people was: ‘We don't want to live in this polluted China. We want a  cleaner, better China.’  And that message was so strong from the middle-class in the big cities like Beijing and Shanghai,  that the political leadership of the Communist Party decided, we need to act because that's  what our constituents want us to do. And secondly, of course, this is an enormous business  opportunity for China. Look, China doesn't have any brand in the car industry. There's no  Chinese Toyota or Volkswagen or General Motors. So, what they can do is to leapfrog into the  new reality of green and clean electric cars where they can capture markets. And we see the  results. BYD, the Shenzhen-based company, is now passing Tesla as the biggest global producer  of electric vehicles. And this year, in all likelihood, China will pass Japan as the biggest exporter  of electric cars in the world. So, this combination of going green is good for the image of the  political leadership with the people and people want this change.  And that is good for the Chinese economy. That's what's making China the lead nation on the  green transformation.  As an example, I mean, three years ago, India had one of the worst cyclones in modern times,  and that's exactly what we expect from more extreme weather coming from climate change. It  happened in the Indian state of Odisha, one of the poorer states in India, still hardly anyone  died. It may have been in the tens who died, which is a very, very low number for such a  horrible storm. There was a lot of material destruction, but hardly anyone died. Why? Because  India has such superb weather forecasting systems, the forecaster told us exactly where the  cyclone will hit. The Chief Minister of the state of Odisha put up buses to bring everyone out to  the hotspot.  And of course, afterwards, no one died from hunger or disease coming from this. In the 1970s,  Bangladesh had a similar cyclone. 500,000 people died at the time because there was no  preparation, no weather forecast, no buses to bring people out, no buildings which were  constructed with the aim of being better suited for this extreme storm. But today, both India  and Bangladesh are much, much better prepared. The coastal areas of Bangladesh, many  houses are built on pillars, communal holes to reach people's houses so that people can gather  there if there's a cyclone hitting, and they can even bring the cows and sheep because poor  people need to take care of the valuable items or animals in the case of a storm. There are a  number of weather forecasting systems on TV, mobile phones. Every Bangladeshi now has a cell  phone and it'll get a warning immediately if something is on the way. So, we are much, much  
better prepared and that's why we see much fewer people dying from the major disasters over  time, even if the forces of nature are even stronger than in the past.  10 years ago, deforestation in Indonesia was very, very high and that was because paper and  pulp companies needed forest to feed their machines. And because if you wanted to export  palm oil, and there are millions of jobs in Indonesia which are based on palm oil, there was the  feeling that you needed to destroy the nature. But then the government put in place good  policies and big captains of Indonesian industries, all those companies had been a part of the  problem in the past. So, they said, "Look, we can improve and increase our production of both  paper and pulp and palm oil on the already destroyed land. There's plenty of land which is  already destroyed. Let's use that and let's make sure that the rainforest is intact because then  we get both the protection of the most important ecosystem on the planet, but at the same  time, rapid economic growth in Indonesia."  And that's what you're seeing now. Indonesia is on the path to become the fourth biggest  economy in the world by 2050. It has sustained economic growth, bringing people out of  poverty by the day.  This is not really well-known to the world because Indonesians are so modest. They don't brag  about it as some other nations do, so people don't know it, but it's a fantastic economic  development in Indonesia, benefiting the people, people become more. educated, have better  health. When Suharto became the dictator of Indonesia in the 1960s, life expectancy in  Indonesia was around 45, maybe. Now, it's 72. What a progress in one generation. And this can  happen without destroying nature. And of course, say, palm oil is creating millions of jobs; paper  and pulp is also creating a huge amount of jobs, but it can happen with respect for nature.  Elaine Fernandez:  Mitigation   and   adaptation   strategies   to   address   environmental   issues   are   extremely  wide-ranging, and we can learn many lessons by looking to existing efforts from around the  world.  Many countries in Asia, for example, are demonstrating innovative approaches as Mr Solheim  has highlighted. A common factor in these approaches is strong institutions of the state that  encourage collaboration with the private sector and civil society organisations.

Dignity of Work and A Just Transition

### keyTakeaway
This chapter emphasised the critical role of businesses and trade unions in shaping a just and sustainable future, focusing on the necessity of collaborative efforts for systemic change in labour rights and environmental practices.Sharan Burrow stressed the importance of engaging with business leaders to address environmental and labour issues, given that the decision-making of business leadership impacts entire workforces and invested capital. There is a need for a 'just transition' in climate action, ensuring job security and workers' rights are protected even while the world phases down fossil fuels.Trade unions have the decision-making capability to drive global change, particularly in managing large-scale investments and negotiating transitions in industries impacted by environmental policies.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Dignity of Work and A Just Transition  Rohan Hazell :  Work that is not dangerous, dirty, or undignified   are becoming   globally expected standards.  But many workers around the world still face difficult conditions, and this is where business  decision - making becomes extremely important.  To hear how business leaders can positively impact the day to day lives of workers, you'll hear  from   Sharan   Burrow,   former   General   Secretary   of   the   International   Trade   Union  Confederation.  She discusses the transition away from fossil fuels as a case study to explore how workers’  rights must be considered in major industry shifts.  Sharan Burrow:  I can be the worst enemy of business and have been in my career.  But you also have to sit at the table and negotiate the solutions to the challenge that has  created that environment. There's you know, to be honest, I work with the B - team, the  business group of leaders globally who set themselves up to actually have a bo ld and  leadership voice. I've been on the executive of the Business for Inclusive Growth Team.  You know, I helped set up a B - team group of employers right here in Australia when our  business organizations had really lost their way around issues like climate and the dignity of  labour   laws that work for people. But business is essential to the world. And of course, as a  as a trade unionist, particularly in my former role as general secretary of the ITC, we were  responsible also for advocating for the safe stewardship of $40 trillion, m ore than $40 trillion  of workers capital that's invested in the global economy, our pension funds and in that  context, those pension funds have been used to actually promote this exploitative model that  has stripped workers of dignity, but also has, of cou rse, destroyed the environment. And in  that context, we have to do better. So no one could look at   labour   and say that they're not  interested in business. What we are interested in is the fundamental rights for workers that  negotiate with business, with government through the ILO and the capacity to sit at the table  and negotiate not just around working condi tions and shared prosperity through wages, but
  also around the design, for example, of a future with just transition measures for climate  action and indeed for technology, which are, of course interrelated.  It's very simple, really. There are no jobs on a dead planet. If we're going to continue to  destroy the planetary boundaries to go way beyond what is a survival foundation for  humanity, then that's an existential crisis that actually isn't about the planet . This is about  human beings themselves. But if we don't stabilize the climate, if we don't reinvest in  biodiversity, if we don't actually protect and enhance the soils and the forests on which we  depend as human beings, then there are no jobs.  Now, there are jobs in all of those areas. I'm a realist when it comes to the fact that we have  to. Painfully, yes, but painfully as it is exit from coal. Fossil fuels have no part of our future  and the addiction to fossil fuels is actually extraordinary.   It's almost like we are being asked  to give up our livelihoods when really all we're being asked to do is transition the energy base  and therefore also the technological and production cycles of heavy industry and the way we  service our economies in terms   of the utilities that we use every day.  There will be jobs lost in areas like coal, of course. So just transition was the framework that  we coined and fought for during the negotiations at the climate conferences every year. Of  course, Copenhagen collapsed, but in 2015 of Paris, the concept of j ust transition with  workers and secure jobs at the heart was actually embedded in the preamble, along with  human rights. And in that context, it should be the means by which we design all climate  transitions. It's not hard if workers are displaced, then it 's actually about making sure there  are secure pensions for older   workers, bridges   to secure pensions for those who choose to  retire early if they are close to retirement. For younger workers, it's about income support,  redeployment support and indeed reskilling in that hiatus.  And it's about the resilience factors where communities and individuals can depend on the  fact that due to the   situations,   they find themselves in, in terms of global shocks we've just  been through and are still living through the massive health shock of COVID. But of course,  climate disasters, extreme weather events are creating such a level of despair in many  communities.  If you don't have social protection, if the world doesn't fund social protection for the poorest  of people, and that means income, health, education, child care, where it's necessary,  whether it's childcare, aged care, or the broader health ecosystem, we m ust understand that  those are the measures along with investment in industry, in businesses, through renewal of  communities that will give people a sense of security, will get workers to the table to  negotiate their future.  It's often the end result of conversations that I have difficult conversations with workers in  those most energy intensive, fossil fuel driven industries. And they will come to the conclusion  in the end that they are actually energy workers or the steelwor kers or their cement workers
  or their miners in other areas that we need lithium for batteries or sand increasingly in terms  of technology for battery storage and so on, all of the new technologies.  But these workers work in those industries. And while there may be new ones, the industries  of today are in fact the industries of tomorrow, whether it's energy construction, transport  services, the care industry, whatever it might be, all industries have   to transition to net zero.  So we're all in this together. And if just transition means workers are at the table negotiating  and helping the businesses, climate and employment proof their future, that is the future of  the business equals the future of the w orker. So for us, it's very simple, but it is about  recognition that if the transition is not just people will resist it and we will not stabilize the  planet by 2030. That's already a very tall order and we certainly won't get to net zero or  better. Net po sitive, as Paul Polman says, by 2050 and beyond.  Rohan Hazell:  Governments and Labor advocates must work with businesses to ensure the fundamental  rights of workers are secured.  A just transition framework is therefore a crucial means to address climate change whilst  factoring in the social impact of the transition on workers and the community.

Beyond Compliance: Cross-Sectoral Collaboration in Policy Decision-Making

### keyTakeaway
Professor Christine Loh explored how some societal issues require collective responsibility and collaboration across sectors to forge lasting solutions, using waste management as a case study.Transitioning from simple waste collection and landfill use to reducing and recycling waste requires a societal shift. Governments must create policies that encourage the entire society to reduce waste production.To stimulate waste reduction, governments may introduce charges that make waste disposal more expensive, reflecting the costs of waste treatment. This financial incentive aims to change public behaviour towards waste management.Companies can separate waste as part of their internal processes and lobby for governmental changes that create a level playing field in environmental compliance. Proactive companies can gain a competitive advantage by adopting eco-friendly practices early.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  B eyond Compliance: Cross - Sectoral  Collaboration in Policy Decision - Making  Rohan Hazell :  Governments are responsible for nation - wide policymaking, but these decisions aren’t made  in a vacuum.  Professor Christine Loh, Chief Development Strategist at Hong Kong University of Science and  Technology’s Institute for the Environment, suggests that the best policies are made in close  collaboration with the private sector   -   and that businesses should ta ke a proactive role in co -  creating policies that can benefit society as a whole.  Professor Christine Loh:  Let me take waste management as something that requires a major change in society. So, first  of all, if you are used to just collecting all the waste and dumping it in a landfill, what the  government would do is just try to have a very effective way of col lecting waste and then  dumping it in a landfill.  However, if your priorities change, and you want to reduce the total amount of waste then  you would start thinking about how you would reduce waste in society. Now, it isn't the  government that produced the waste. It is everybody in society that produces t he waste. So,  how do you get everyone in society to do so?  So, one way is to charge them, to make it more expensive for them. You're not asking them  just to pay for someone taking the waste away. You're asking them now to pay a lot more for  the waste to be taken away because the waste has to be treated and the tr eatment costs, you  are going to wrap it up into a waste charge, right? So, this is the directional change.  Now, politicians can object to this, they can say; “No, the people won't like it, they will object  because it's too complicated.” But over time, people do accept that we can't carry on like  that. Waste reduction, waste recycling, because if you don't separ ate the waste, you can't  recycle. So, people understand the priorities have to change.
  But once you say, how am I going to design a system that is going to work in my city to actually  get people to change their behaviour, to charge them an amount that will stimulate them to  change their behaviour, pass what kind of laws that they must separa te the waste?  And then you have to actually create a whole chain of events, and also purchase of equipment  and plants to actually process the waste for recycling.  So, actually it is a very big deal, and if we look back at different cities around the world that  have done that, no one has done them from one day to the next. And if you track efforts by  different cities, it usually takes quite a number of years for them   to go on the simple step to  eventually having a whole system in place and every step of the way, there is actually some  politics because you have to persuade people yet again to do something different.  There are two issues here. One is that a company can only do so much. So, for example a  company can separate waste by itself, but there isn't a public system that actually takes the  waste to recycling that means the company's own efforts will be insufficie nt. Or some people  would say, well, it's a waste of time for me to do it because the whole system is not there,  and that would be correct.  Now, the second issue is, so what can a company do? So, a company can of course also lobby  a government to say, we are ready for the change. If you change, you are actually creating a  new level playing field where all companies have to do the same thing.  So, a company doesn't have to resist and say, well, you know, it's more complicated and more  expensive, so I don't want to do it. They can actually say, we know this is better for society  and we are prepared to do it. And actually, we want everybody to do   it because that would  be a new level playing field.  The other thing that they can do is, for example, in decarbonisation. If they believe that the  future is about a much lower carbon world, a civil, a zero - carbon world, if they were the first  to do something that will crack the nut, they could be the compan y that will reap the benefit  the fastest.  So, a company has to think through itself where it wants to position itself. In terms of doing  something that it is prepared to do but it can't do all by itself.  One of the things that is an acknowledged winner between collaboration of business, civil  society and government, is something called the Fair Winds Charter.  So we know that big ships actually pollute a lot because they burn bunker fuel. And bunker  fuel is the dirtiest of fuels. So some years ago in Hong Kong, we decided that what we want is  for ships to use a cleaner fuel when they sail into Hong Kong, so that   when they're in Hong
  Kong waters, the amount of pollution that they put out would be less and that the people  would benefit because the people would be able to not suffer from as much air pollution.  At one time the NGO that I was a member of called Civic Exchange, actually it is a think tank.  We worked for two years with the shipping sector, so these are shippers and ship owners. We  asked them if they were willing to do more, and actually they came up   with the idea that they  could try to persuade the government to create a new level playing field by entering into a  voluntary arrangement called the Fair Winds Charter. So, these are a number of companies  coming together saying that they are willing to sw itch to a cleaner fuel when their ships berth  in Hong Kong.  The shipping companies felt that they all lived in Hong Kong. They were operating in Hong  Kong, even though some of the companies were international companies, they felt that this  is something that they can do, and similar laws had already emerged in parts   of the United  States and also in Northern Europe. So, they thought that they could do something similar in  this part of the world, and they knew how to do it, the technology of switching fuels. So, it  was driven by their sense of social responsibility.  So because they were willing to do this voluntarily at their own cost, they became a powerful  advocate in front of the government to say, look, we know what we are doing. This is our  industry. We want to be good citizens, and we are prepared to do this at   our own cost. What  we want you to do is to change the law.  So, change the law to require all ships when they berth in Hong Kong to switch to a cleaner  fuel. Well, this became a success in Hong Kong. This policy was then suggested to the national  government in China, who also eventually adopted the same policy.  And it actually went further because the national government together with the shipping  sector actually decided that even when the ships sail into a certain area of waters that they  should already switch to a cleaner fuel. So, this is an acknowledged succe ss in the  environmental world, particularly for the maritime sector.  Rohan Hazell:  Government regulations can create incentives and a level playing field   -   but only when the  private sector is involved in the decision - making process.  To contribute to redesigning society, companies must be proactive in collaborating with  governments   in   identifying   opportunities   to   address   externalities,   and   in   lobbying  policymakers to create the right conditions for industry - wide transformation.

Algorithm Fit vs Workflow Fit: Applying AI in Your Organisation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Dan Wong delved into the complexities of integrating AI within existing business processes, emphasising the need to maintain a balance between technological capabilities and the human elements of workflows.To successfully adopt new technologies, an alignment between the technology and workflows is needed, so workflows are enhanced and not significantly disrupted.While AI can optimise certain processes, it must fit into the operational context without overwhelming the human elements, such as staff responsibilities and existing procedures.Continuous dialogue between AI developers, operational staff, and management is necessary to ensure that AI implementations are both technologically effective and practically beneficial.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Algorithm Fit vs Workflow Fit:  Applying AI in Your Organisation  Tsubasa Nair:  Whenever a business is looking to adopt a new technology, system or process, it's a given that  this technology must improve existing operations. But sometimes innovations don't meet this  baseline because it's all too easy to miss out on a key component of   transformation: the human  element. When it comes to AI, striking the right balance between its capabilities and how it fits  within your company's existing workflows is the real challenge.  To shed light on this and more, let’s hear from Dan Wong, CEO of GIFT.ed.   Dan has been the CEO  of an AI - focused business and has driven and implemented over 30 AI projects at the global  transport company, MTR, for which he was GM of Global Innovation.  Dan is also an Adjunct Professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University, where he teaches a course on  AI and Product Innovation.  Dan will explore the nuances of integrating AI in a way that both respects and enhances the  human elements of our workflows.  Dan Wong:  All technologies are ultimately designed to actually change the   workflow,   and this is a bit of the  conundrum, because if you change it too much, what happens is the technology does not get  deployed in practice, which basically defeats the purpose of using the technology. It's often very  natural and easy to focus on optimising t he technology part because it seems like a much more  solvable problem.   Certainly,   it's much more concrete than considering the human elements of AI  deployments. Things such as what are the habits, what are the work habits, what's the workflow,  what are personal incentives for individuals, even departments?  These tend to be very difficult to address and so there's a natural tendency to just focus on  optimising the technology solution, what I call algorithm optimisation. However, when you do  this and you do not sufficiently consider the workflow, it doesn't co me to deployment.
  A very interesting case study is a case study from MTR Corporation, and this is a case study that  I have personally been involved in driving and deploying. And it's actually a very simple use case.  For a corporation like MTR, which provides public transportation, metro and rail in Hong Kong,  safety is a very big concern. We have maintenance crew that nightly inspect all of our railroad  tracks and there are kilometres and kilometres of railroad tracks . We look for any kind of cracks,  micro fissures, any displacement of anything. And this is done traditionally in a very manual way.  We have crew that walk down the track and visually inspect everything. We use sticks to listen  to the sound coming back fro m the tracks. And obviously this is not a scalable   solution,   and we  cannot cover all the tracks. Deploying AI here is a very obvious and actually understandable  application. And what's very surprising is that sometimes in use cases like this that are fairly  obvious, sometimes it doesn't work. And the reason it does n't work is the algorithm fit versus  workflow fit that we are discussing.  The solution is very simple.  The solution to this particular use case was to put   high - definition   camera underneath our trains,  what we call the rolling stock. And as the trains go on the track, they capture in real time all the  images of the track. This information is then gathered and then put through a machine learning  algorithm to look for areas o f concern.  So when the team brought this forward to me, there were two teams. One team was the  operating team. The operating team has a pain point here. They're the ones tasked with doing  this inspection nightly, and they don't have enough resources to do it. So they   were very highly  motivated to come forward to find a technology solution.  The other department that came forward is the MTR data studio. This is the department within  MTR that have our data scientists. They have the ability to actually build our own training models  and our own neural networks, and so they can then take these ima ges, train our own model, and  to come up with the areas that we need to be concerned. And so the data studio team, the data  scientist, they collected the data, and they wanted to make sure that they caught all the  problems, all the potential problems. Righ t. When they do that, naturally they're going to be  some false positives. Actually, there are many false positives, but they needed to ensure that  they caught everything.  And herein lies the problem, because the operating department is looking for the opposite. They  actually, any warning they get, they want to have very, very high confidence that that is actually
  a problem. They do not want to get a list of a thousand possible issues which they now must track  down one by one. And so this is where the conflict came. And it comes down, in very simple  terms, to the individual incentives and responsibilities of these t wo departments.  However, the data studio's responsibility is to catch all errors. And if it turns out that there's a  live case where there is an accident and a safety issue and they didn't catch it, it will be their  responsibility and their neck on the block. And so they   were not willing to train a model that  reduced the number of false positives.  If you flip it around and we look at the operating department, they have known pain. Actually,  they rather not know. They rather not know that there were a thousand potential issues, because  their responsibility, if something happens and if it comes out, w hy did they not go and look at  that particular issue that was raised? And from an operating perspective, it's simply impossible  to look at all the issues.  But then with this system now it has caused some harm, because now there is an audited trail  whereby   they did not take action on a possible issue. And so from an operating department  perspective, they could not deploy the solution and therefore there was a bit of a standstill.  Now, if you take a look at this from purely an algorithm perspective, of course this is solvable.  Just find a solution where you find the right level of the false positives. It won't be zero, but you  find the right level. But the big problem in this partic ular case is that it comes down to the  workflow fit and actually more directly the work incentives. The individual incentives and  responsibility of the department. And therein lies the difficulty. So this is a very good example to  illustrate once again the   difference between algorithm fit and workflow fit.  And this is one of the key takeaways here, that if you do not find the right balance, ultimately  you will not deploy your solution. And deploying the solution and finding the right balance very  often comes down to not trying to fix a technology problem by   fixing an organisation problem.  And that is then incumbent upon us as leaders to find the way forward, to first understand what  those workflow issues, what those human elements of technology deployment are, recognise  these and then find a way, as managemen t does, to a solution that can then find a path whereby  solutions like this can be deployed to the benefit of the organisation. So that is the difference  between what was meant by algorithm fit versus workflow fit.  So in very simple terms, when we're talking about algorithm fit, we're trying to optimise the  technology implementation around this particular solution. When we talk about workflow fit,
  we're trying to fit the solution to the natural way people work. And of course, there's a natural  balance between the two, because when you're deploying the solution and the technology,  you're actually trying to have some modification to the workflow. And   therefore,   the challenge  and the opportunity is finding the right balance between these two parts of the spectrum.  Tsubasa Nair:  From Dan’s insights it’s evident that integrating technologies into our workflows is not just a  technical challenge but a fundamentally human one as well.  Technology must be a complement, not a replacement, that enhances productivity without  undermining the existing strengths of our workforce  Dan also stressed the importance of ongoing dialogue between AI developers, operational staff,  and management to ensure that each group's concerns and insights are addressed, which is  crucial for fine - tuning AI systems to serve actual business needs.

Conflict and Societal Traumas

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the two remaining societal shortfalls that pose existential threats: conflict and societal traumas. Despite periods of relative peace and the rise of multilateral institutions that govern international relations, conflict remains a feature of modern society. It includes civil wars, proxy conflicts, territorial disputes, and more. Modern conflicts also involve new modes of indirect conflict, like economic sanctions and cyberattacks. Conflict in all its forms has far-reaching impacts on public spending, political decision-making, international relations, and market regulation. Deeper understanding and appreciation of conflict are vital for governments, businesses, and civil society organisations to respond appropriately. Societal traumas include chronic mental and physical health issues, loss of cultural norms and identity due to globalisation, and the erosion of the social fabric and social contract. These challenges are fueled by factors such as stress, anxiety, and inequality, and they threaten the wellbeing and cohesion of communities. These societal shortfalls are interconnected with the drivers of change, economic policies, social norms, and governance systems, highlighting the need to address them collectively.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Con fl ict and Societal Traumas  Rohan Hazell:  Societal traumas refer to the gap between the reality on the ground, and the state required for  communities to flourish. We've already covered two of them in the last chapter: lack of access  to basic needs, and epidemics and pandemics. There are two more that pose existential threats,  which we'll explore now: conflict and societal traumas.  Conflict  The threats posed by conflict are clear. Beyond needless loss of life, large-scale conflict can lead  to the displacement of entire populations, as well as the destruction of key infrastructure and  the disruption of the economy. These consequences can take generations to reverse, leading to  social fragmentation, stalled development, and regional or global instability.  The first half of the 20th century saw the World Wars take place, which were the most  destructive in human history. It's tempting to say that the world has enjoyed a period of relative  peace   and   stability   since   then,   particularly   with   the   rise   of   more   effective   multilateral  institutions that provide forums for diplomacy.  But the reality is that conflict remains a feature of modern society. The war in Ukraine, which  ramped up to new levels of intensity in 2022 is perhaps the most obvious example. But in the  last several decades, There have also been countless civil wars, proxy conflicts, and disputes  over territory and resources.  These continue to take place around the world. And as society advances economically and  technologically, so do the techniques used in conflict situations. Deepening global economic and  political interconnections mean that the balance of power between nations is becoming  increasingly complex.  What has emerged as a result are new modes of indirect conflict, like economic sanctions,  which have serious implications for sanctioned populations. For example, Cuba is a country that  has famously been subject to American sanctions for nearly six decades. The United Nations has  estimated this sanctions regime has cost Cuba nearly 130 billion dollars, an extremely significant  
amount for a country of just 11 million people. Similarly, advances in technology create entirely  new arenas for conflict, including cyber attacks and information warfare.  The governments of India, the US, Indonesia, and China reported the highest number of attacks  on their systems in 2023, with an increase of almost 95 percent during the latter half of 2022.  These attacks have the potential to harm key infrastructure, like electricity grids, and even  impact the value of currencies.  While most of us are fortunate not to be living in conflict zones, the risk of conflict in all its  forms still has a bearing on public spending, political decision making, international relations,  and how markets are regulated. This is why having a deeper understanding and appreciation of  conflict is vital for governments, businesses, and civil society organisations to be better able to  respond to its far-reaching impacts.  Societal Traumas  The final shortfall is societal traumas, which are the challenges that erode the well being and  cohesion of communities, threatening the very fabric of society. There are three main aspects  we'll look at. First, in both higher and lower income countries, we are seeing a rise in chronic  mental and physical health issues.  In the US, for example, it is predicted that by 2050, Nearly half of adults over the age of 50 will  be living with at least one chronic health issue. These conditions are fueled by factors such as  stress, anxiety, and the lack of access to basic needs. These health disparities can make  marginalised groups even more vulnerable, especially as they worsen existing inequalities.  Second, the most recent wave of globalisation is resulting in loss of cultural norms and identity  on a scale that humanity has never had to grapple with. Widespread westernisation is a great  example. With the erosion of cultural heritage by the spread of modern western norms, there  comes a sense of identity loss, alienation, and a weakened social bond, especially between  different generations.  This is by no means saying that Western culture is bad, but it may not always be best suited to  the communities experiencing these shifts. This brings us to the final point, which is the  unravelling of the social fabric and social contract. Trust is the ultimate currency of any cohesive  society. When that trust is strained by rising inequality, political polarisation, or discrimination,  it becomes much harder for societies to address collective challenges and respond effectively to  other existential threats.  
Addressing societal traumas might seem like a problem beyond the remit of most organisations,  particularly those in the private sector. But the reality is that we all contribute to the collective  strength of our communities. Being able to effectively redesign society means understanding  what impact we as individuals and our organisations are having in the wider world, and how we  can make that role as positive and constructive as possible.  And with that, we've wrapped up the third component of the redesigning society framework.  These 10 existential threats are all significant challenges on their own, but it's important to  leave this module recognising that they are closely interconnected and are also linked to the  drivers of change, which aggravate their impact on people and the planet.  Examining these existential threats can easily make us feel pessimistic about the future, but we  can't sweep them under the rug any longer. It's absolutely vital that you, your organisation, your  community, and your government get to grips with the challenges facing our societies. In one  way or another, we are all impacted by these existential threats, and that's why we all have a  stake in finding solutions to them.  In the modules ahead, we'll be shifting gears to look at the limitless possibilities for overcoming  these challenges, hear from global experts committed to redesigning society, and be inspired by  case studies from the front lines of positive change.

Sustainable Development: Why Develop Sustainably in the First Place? 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the pressing need to rethink sustainable development to prioritise the wellbeing of all stakeholders in the ecosystem.Development that focuses purely on improving economic metrics fails to recognise nor account for the environmental crises and societal shortfalls it can cause. Thus, not reforming policy and corporate practices to prioritise social and environmental responsibility risks perpetuating the prevailing environmental crises and societal shortfalls we face.Development should be reframed to place the wellbeing of society as the central metric to gauge progress, which will lead to more sustainable and equitable economic and social systems.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Sustainable Development:  Why develop sustainably   in the first place?  Rohan Hazell :  "National development" is a phrase we often hear. But what does it actually mean? It's usually  used in the context of economic growth. But in truth, this is just one aspect of national  development. In fact, most definitions of development centre around imp rovements in  standard of living for citizens. And while a strong and vibrant economy is critical to achieve  this aim, it is not the only consideration.  This raises the question: If improved wellbeing is the ultimate outcome of development, and  not just economic growth, then to what degree should environmental and social concerns  factor into developmental efforts? This is one of the key issues to consider   when discussing  sustainable development in today's world.  To answer this question, you'll hear from Dr. Mamphela Ramphele, South African politician,  anti - apartheid activist, medical doctor and businesswoman. Dr. Ramphele is also a former  Managing Director of the World Bank and she draws on all her years of experi ence on the  front lines and in the boardroom to share her views on how sustainable development can  take place. As a pioneer and advocate for socioeconomic progress in her own country and  around the world, Dr. Ramphele explains how national development can   be achieved without  compromising the wellbeing of society or the environment.  Dr. Mamphela Ramphele:  The first point should be about asking the question: What do we want to accomplish? What  is the transformation in aid of? If the transformation is to enhance the wellbeing of all people  and to promote a healthy ecosystem, then the approach and the choices   we make will be  different. The traditional transformational approach is normally driven by a development  paradigm that puts a very big emphasis on economics and the growth of the economy, which  is all about having. What do you have as a nation? What do you   have as an individual?  Whereas if the focus is on wellbeing and a healthy ecosystem, the focus is going to be on  being. And this is the beautiful thing about we are called human beings. We are inherently a  relational species. No single human being can thr ive alone in the desert or in the forest. We  are wired to be with others, to be supported by others. We are at our best when we are  relating to people who give us love, support, and that is mutual.
  And so my major point about how do we approach transformation is to say, let us put aside  this starting place of trade - offs. And the trade - offs are a product of a development paradigm  that says you've got to grow the economy and if a few people get left ou t, it's part of what  they call collateral damage. If the ecosystem gets polluted, it's part of the culture. No. I am  criticising the approach to development that is linear, and at the heart of that is the idea that  to be developed, quote unquote, is to hav e a higher GDP, to have billionaires and millionaires.  That's a value system of having.  If we shift to the value system of being, a society that is highly developed is a society where  no child goes to bed hungry, no old person is sitting lonely at home. Everybody is catered for  with a safe, reliable public transport and other public services.   And where every citizen feel  that they belong and they contribute. And so it is time for us now to jettison the idea of GDP  as a measure of development to the idea of wellbeing for a healthy planet as the measure of  development. In that measure, no one is   developed as we speak. And no one should be called  underdeveloped. Because coming from a country like mine, which is not a poor country, but  a country that has missed the opportunity to leverage its huge resources to make sure that  every citizen is well a nd is feeling good about themselves and contributing to the wellbeing  and the health of our ecosystem.  I think the root cause of the problem has been the colonising of the world by Europe and  America in particular. And this colonisation was motivated by the need to extract resources,  mineral, natural, human, in terms of slavery. And the damage of that legac y is not taken into  consideration when people talk about developed and developing countries. So called  developed countries have taken away from those they call underdeveloped. The resources  they need not to be developed, but to create wellbeing societies a nd healthy ecosystems.  And so putting away this label of developed, developed calls for conversations about how do  we have mutual, supportive conversations about the need for global just transitions away  from GDP - driven growth models to wellbeing and healthy ecosystem models.  And so what I'm calling for is a reimagination of our understanding of development, which  has to be human development, with people at the centre. And every person matters. There  isn't a person who is collateral damage. We have to stop this practice of exte rnalising costs to  the environment and to people we regard as expendable and internalising all the benefits.  And when we approach, whatever we do with that mindset, we will not continue the carnage  that we are visiting upon nature and upon our fellow human   beings. And in contrast, we will  see just how abundant the resources become when we share. As they say, sharing is caring.  Rohan Hazell:  As Dr. Ramphele puts it, if we are to achieve sustainable development, we must begin by  clarifying the purpose of our efforts. This purpose can be solely aimed at economic growth.  But for the most part, the deeper aim of development is ultimately to raise   standards of living
  and improve the overall wellbeing of society. By reframing the definition of development this  way, we can start to look beyond the narrative that it must always be a trade - off or zero sum  game, where for one party to gain, another must lose.  In this way, we can start to view sustainable development as a collective effort that benefits  not only the wellbeing of societies, but also the natural ecosystems that support them.

The Political Economy: Economic Policy Making

### keyTakeaway
Drawing on extensive experience in policy making and involvement in multilateral discussions, Professor Jayati Ghosh highlighted the impact of economic policy on people's lives - and the need to create better alternatives.The Green New Deal project and proposals from the High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism signify a global awareness of the need for alterations in international economic architecture.Government responsiveness to pressing global issues is contingent on citizens' demands and actions. This means there is a need for greater awareness, spreading of information, and active citizen participation.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Political Economy: Econom ic   Policy Making  Rohan Hazell:  How is economic policy shaped at the international level? Is there fair representation of  economic interests between higher - income and lower - income nations?  To answer these questions, we speak with Jayati Ghosh, Professor of Economics at the University  of Massachusetts Amherst.  As a seasoned policy advisor with extensive experience across various global platforms, she  shares her view on the role of major players in global policy, such as the G7 and G20, and their  disproportionate impact on economic decisions that affect the entir e world.  Prof. Jayathi Ghosh:  I have been associated with different attempts at policy making and policy shaping for most of  my professional career. When I was in India for 35 years, teaching at Jawaharlal Nehru University,  I was involved not only with social movements and trade unions   and others, but also with the  National Knowledge Commission, which reported to the Prime Minister of India with a  commission on Farmers Welfare in Andhra Pradesh with the state governments of West Bengal  and a bunch of others. So, I have always been very   concerned with the impact of economic policy  making on people and whether it   is   actually delivering what it should do.  Right now I   am   also involved in some of these discussions at a multilateral level. I   am   a member  of the UN High - level Advisory Board on Economic and Social Affairs, which is chaired by the  Under - Secretary - General for Social and Economic Affairs. I'm a member of the High - level  Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism.  This was set up by the Secretary - General last March with the idea that we propose ways forward  in a world in which multilateralism seems to be losing its way and seems to be less relevant for  various reasons, as you know, and yet when it's more important t han ever.  I'm also in the World Health Organisation's Council on the Economics of Health for All, where we  are trying to look at how to shape an economy that meets the needs of health for all, rather than  you know, forcing people to meet the needs of the economy.
  So, there are various other organisations I'm involved with. There is the INET Commission on  Global Economic Transformation, which is also trying to first of all recognise the huge and  momentous changes that are occurring in our global economy, and then pr oposing ways that we  can address them and deal with them.  And I'm currently the co - chair with Joseph Stiglitz of the Independent Commission for the Reform  of International Corporate Taxation. And here we recognize that fiscal concerns are one of the  big issues why, especially developing countries low -   and middle - income countries can't do the  necessary things for their people, for the planet, and we point to ways in which you can actually  improve taxation and that it's really a set of very archaic global and national rules that is enabling  multinational companies t o get away with much less tax than is paid by their domestic companies  and is enabling very rich people, high net worth individuals to escape the tax net almost entirely.  So, these are all different ways in which we are trying to propose alternatives to the current  system, which I do believe is now dysfunctional.  In a book that has just been   published by the club of Rome   -   it's called Earth for All. It's a survival  guide for humanity, and I'm very proud to have been able to do this, co - authoring with members  of the Club of Rome, including some authors of the original report Limits to Growth wa y back 50  years ago.  Now, what we are really suggesting is that actually, humanity faces a very stark choice. If we  continue with business - as - usual, we are going to be facing economic collapse and ecological  destruction. And social and political tensions of a kind that we cann ot even imagine right now.  However, we do have other possibilities. We can do a very different thing with five turnarounds,  focusing on poverty, on inequality, on changing our food systems, on ensuring that everybody  has a minimum decent livelihood, on ele ctrifying everything and thereby saving a huge amount  of the carbon emissions. So we can make these changes.  Some countries are increasingly recognising the need. Even in the European Union, they are  recognizing the need, they have a new European Green Deal project, which incorporates some  of the elements of this. There are countries in the developing world which   are very conscious of  this need.  Barbados is leading what it calls the Bridgetown Initiative, which is looking at changes in the  international order, but also changes in domestic economic policy. They come from a small island  economy, which is completely under threat of climate change, an d they're talking about how we  can make the changes partly domestically, partly regionally, but we can demand the changes in  the international economic architecture, and they   are   suggesting very reasonable ways out of  this.  There are proposals across the world. I'm a member, as I mentioned, of a High - level Board on  Effective Multilateralism, and we are suggesting changes in the global financial architecture, in
  the global governance of climate, which we hope will actually generate some alternatives, and  where more and more countries, I think, are going to be willing to listen simply because the  alternative is so stark.  I think people can do so much, and in fact, even in the Earth for All book we emphasised it has to  be popular mobilisation that forces these changes. It will not happen just with governments  suddenly seeing the light and becoming good. We as people, as citizens, we have to force that  change.  And that means operating at every level at local levels, sure. But also mobilising for national  policies, mobilising, demanding that your governments negotiate with a different framework.  And enough people are not doing this. There isn't even enough awaren ess, I don't think many  people in the Global North are even aware of all the implications of the TRIPS Agreement in terms  of sharing knowledge.  We've seen what happened during the pandemic, but this is also important for green  technologies to enable other countries to actually do the green transition that is so necessary. So  we have to have greater awareness, people have to spread the word. People   have to learn about  these things and then tell others. Then they have to mobilise. They have to demand. They have  to write letters to the elected representatives. They have to be on the street. They have to  demonstrate. They have to make a noise, and make   a large enough noise that governments  actually are forced to listen.  Rohan Hazell:  As Professor Ghosh has shared, economic transformation requires top down   and   bottom up  approaches. Governments must create policies that better serve their people and protect the  environment, and citizens can incentivise this by becoming more aware of the impact of current  economic policies and mobilising to demand change.

Cross-Sector Opportunities: Civil Society, Government, and Media

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Karim Rushdy highlighted the pivotal role CSOs play in policymaking, conflict resolution, and media collaboration.CSOs, like pressure groups and industry associations, have historically influenced policymakers through awareness-raising and applying pressure using scientific evidence and community engagement.Civil society fosters dialogue among groups with diverse beliefs and backgrounds, mediating conflicts and contributing to peacebuilding efforts, also known as "Track II Diplomacy."In some countries, civil society faces constraints from governments and business interests, limiting their ability to operate freely and engage with the media.CSOs collaborate with the media, especially in whistleblowing, to expose unethical behaviour and drive change through awareness on various platforms.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Cross-Sector Opportunities: Civil Society, Government and  Media  Host:  Just as the relationship between business and civil society can be simultaneously complex yet  fruitful, so is its relationship with the other two pillars of society: government and media.  The most visible expression of this is public protest against government decision-making, as  we’ve seen in recent years with regard to climate change, conflict, economic policy and issues of  gender and race.  Let’s hear more from Karim Rushdy, former Managing Director at GIFT and Advisor to GIFT.ed.  Karim Rushdy:  So there's a long history of civil society fostering dialogue with the public sector and also  changing public opinion. So raising awareness around these issues which in turn puts pressure  on policymakers to act, to legislate, to regulate around these topics.  These civil society organisations could be pressure groups, so they could be movements like, for  example, Black Lives Matter or Extinction Rebellion, but they could also be industry  associations. They could be labour unions, they could be the automotive industry association  that has representatives from many different automotive companies on it, for example. And  there's a lot of different ways and examples in the past of civil society doing just this, of forcing  policymakers to act.  So if you take for example, pollution control, over the last several decades, this did not happen  by magic. It was often civil society organisations, scientific organisations, community groups  who put pressure on government, saying we don't want our waterways to be dirty, we don't  want our air to be smoggy. And that led to policymakers over time to legislate in these areas.  
Smoking is another example. It wasn't that long ago that you could smoke in public places, you  could smoke in restaurants, you could smoke even on aeroplanes. And it was through pressure  from civil society. And a lot of this were healthcare-related groups, doctors associations, et  cetera, who put pressure on government, presented the science and the data to them of the  negative impacts of smoking and also raised awareness within wider society. So you've got  citizens also putting pressure on the government. And that then led to the changes that we see  today where in most countries it's pretty hard to smoke in public places and it's getting harder  and harder to even purchase cigarettes in many parts of the world now because they're hidden  behind the counter, you know, and not displayed. Advertising has been banned. So these are  some of an example there.  When it comes to industry associations, professional associations, they may work with the  government, encourage, put pressure, present information that leads to the setting of new  industry standards around quality, around provision of services and what those service  standards and levels should be. Also fostering dialogue so civil society can play a really key role  in mediating conflict, in fostering dialogue between groups which otherwise would find it very,  very difficult to come together. There are many such organisations.  The Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, which is a Swiss-based civil society organisation, has  been very active in conflict zones for many decades now, from the Philippines to different parts  of Africa and even parts of Europe, the Baltic states. And what they do is bring together groups  who have different beliefs, different political views, perhaps different ethnic and cultural  histories, and help those groups to reach mutual understanding.  So while governments may be having a dialogue at one level, you'd also have behind the scenes  civil society organisations mediating, bringing people together and fostering productive  dialogue. This is sometimes called 'Track Two Diplomacy". So the relationship between civil  society and media really differs from country to country, and it's dependent on a few factors.  The first would be what is the state of the media landscape in a given country? Is it dominated  by the government? Is it only government owned media outlets, which, there are many  countries where that is the case. Is it a very kind of free and diverse media landscape, where  you have many different private companies, large and small, that are operating media outlets?  Is it a monopoly or a monopoly of a few different companies who control most of the media  outlets in a given country? So the state of the media landscape is something to consider.  
The other is the state of the government. What form of government is it? Is it a liberal Western  democracy? Is it an autocracy? Is it a social market economy? And related to state of the  government would be what is the state and vibrancy of the civil society sector?  So in some countries, civil society is free to act. There are other countries where civil society  activities are heavily suppressed and controlled, and anything outside of the government,  outside of business, is seen as a threat to those two sectors, and therefore they are not free to  do the work that they need to do. They're often shackled or they operate within serious  constraints.  So with all that being said, you can see why the relationship between media and civil society  would vary from country to country. So if in a certain country, CSOs are seen as anti-business,  anti-government, and if in those countries, the media is controlled by big business, controlled  by government, then civil society may be given very, very little airtime, if any. Now, on the flip  side of that, if civil society is aligned with the ruling party or the government of the day, then  civil society will be given a lot of airtime on the TV, on the radio and on the Internet.  Another of the ways that civil society will collaborate with the media is when it comes to  whistleblowing. So we see from time to time individuals coming out supported by the media,  writing articles, giving interviews in the media and blowing the whistle on very bad behaviour,  either within companies, within a certain industry or in the government. So the media can play  a really key role in supporting civil society when it comes to raising awareness, regardless of  what the issue is that that CSO is working on.  Host:  Civil society has a long and colourful relationship with government and media alike. One of its  most important roles has been to put pressure on governments to enact fair legislation, as seen  in pollution control, whistleblowing, and labour rights.  It can even mediate conflicts and foster dialogue between groups with different political views,  and cultural backgrounds. For these reasons, civil society is increasingly being seen as a potent  partner for governments and media to heed public opinion.  But the relationship between civil society, government and media varies by country. If aligned,  civil society may receive favourable attention and exposure; if seen as a threat, it may be  ignored.  
This is one of the many challenges civil society faces, a topic we’ll look further into in the next  chapter.

Cultural Globalisation: Beyond Capitalism

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair explored how globalisation extends beyond capitalism to include the transfer and evolution of culture and identity. Globalisation extends beyond economic factors like GDP and trade, to encompass the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across borders, which has persisted for centuries. In the context of food, globalisation has facilitated the exchange of ingredients and culinary traditions for centuries.Sports has served as a globalising force by bringing people together across cultures and geographical boundaries. However, the dominance of Western sports in the global arena speaks to the broader asymmetry in the exchange of cultures between the Western and non-Western worlds.Language is a crucial aspect of globalisation, as increasingly, words and phrases borrowed from other cultures are being integrated into our speech. 

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Cultural Globalisation: Beyond Capitalism  Rohan Hazell:  As globalisation has matured over the last 50 years, we’ve seen that it encompasses broader  aspects than just trade and commerce. Rather, it also includes the transfer and evolution of  culture and identity.  In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair shares his thoughts on the different areas of  cultural globalisation.  Chandran Nair:  So, here's some examples of globalisation beyond capitalism and growth. And this is the fun bit  of globalisation too. But this sort of globalisation has actually been going on for a long, long  time. We often see globalisation as just what contributes to GDP, trade, business, technology.  But globalisation is about ideas. It's about cultures. It's about people crossing borders. It's about  people reading books.  Let me give you a couple of examples that for us, all of us are easy to identify. It's food. It's using  ingredients from other regions and adopting other food cultures as your own. This didn't start in  the last 20 or 30 years because Thai food became popular or Japanese food became popular.  This started hundreds of years ago with the Europeans finding out there was an exotic thing  called pepper. And I'm very clear not to use the word discover because they didn't discover it.  They found something called pepper and then they found out there were things called cloves  and used it in their foods, et cetera, things that were being used in India, in Indonesia for  hundreds of years.  So, the globalisation of food is one aspect of globalisation, that of course is enabled by trade  and business, et cetera. But the essence of that globalisation is a desire for people to taste food  and to adopt the cultures of other people.  Then there's of course, sports. We often see globalisation as just what contributes to the GDP,  as I said. But all of us know that sports now, although it's big business, it's bringing people  together in ways that are globalising us in ways that perhaps 30 or 40 years ago, none of us  imagined. So foreign sports are now part of local sports in landscapes.  
But therein, even within sports, it has to be said there is an export of Western sports and sports  clubs, et cetera, to the non-Western world and very little of the reverse. That's part of the  Westernisation of the world. So today we have people in Asia watching the NFL and basketball,  which 20 - 30 years ago, very few people watched. Of course television technology enabled that,  but very few sports from Africa or Asia are exported to the West. So, therein the old world still is  very much in place when it comes to these sorts of exchanges.  But today people from all parts of the world enjoy the sports and become fan club members of  sports organisations from around the world.  And then there is culture. This is so important, and I think we can all say that art, architecture,  and cultural influences are now being shared in ways that many people didn't share before.  Today, because of technology, you can essentially almost have virtual tours or some of the  architecture of the world and even go and view some of the great exhibitions in the world  anywhere you want.  The challenge will be, how do we make these things become more accessible to real people, but  also not allow people to divorce themselves from the reality of actually going to those places in  their own countries to accept culture. So globalisation is also a culture. And by culture, I also  mean books, reading different books, et cetera, and therein lies still many barriers in terms of  what literature we access.  There's still very much in the non-Western world, not enough access to non-Western literature  from   other   countries.   Most   of   us   still   have   access   to   literature,   particularly   from   the  Anglosphere, but not from even our neighbouring countries. So those are other aspects of  globalisation that have been ignored and really things that as individuals, we should seek to  essentially search and share with others.  And then there's language. Increasingly borrowed words and phrases from other cultures are  becoming part and parcel of the way we speak. Of course at the moment, English is sort of the  language of the world. A Malaysian can only speak to a person in Indonesia, or not in Indonesia,  in Thailand using the English language et cetera. And thus, English is the international language.  But within that, many terms are being added that essentially use a bit of English, local terms, et  cetera, and have become part and parcel of the English language. Things like “add oil” is an  entry in the Oxford English dictionary and is just the sort of latest Cantonese phrase to hit  mainstream. And there are hundreds of others around the world.  So, language too is becoming very important, and one should also also be aware that as we  master more languages, we become a lot more culturally sensitive and we can reach out to  people more. So, I would urge all of you to, if you have the opportunity to make sure that you  
learn at least one other language and be able to communicate with others in their language,  because it gives you a sense of who they are and their culture and their history.  Rohan Hazell:  Economic globalisation is undeniably important. But just as important is to recognise and  embrace the diverse ways in which globalisation occurs, including cultural exchanges and  interpersonal connections.  Understanding how these trends have impacted you, your organisation, and your country are  important for enriching cooperation and identifying new areas for opportunity in a rapidly  changing world.

Can the Benefits of Globalisation Continue?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted the benefits and drawbacks of globalisation, and why the phenomenon itself cannot be stopped.Globalisation has brought tremendous economic growth and development over the past few decades, due to increased integration into the global economy.The effects of globalisation are not limited to specific regions but are felt globally. The rapid changes brought about by globalisation have been profound across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, significantly improving people's standards of living.The phenomenon that is globalisation cannot be halted and will continue to persist, as it has throughout human history - its form may be different from today’s globalisation, but this does not mean “de-globalisation.”Many of the existential threats facing humanity are man-made, and cannot be separated from the process of globalisation.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Can the Bene   its of Globalisation Continue?  Rohan Hazell:  Globalisation has had undeniable benefits for many countries across the world, helping to  improve standards of living, opening new trade channels, and fostering greater understanding  of other cultures.  But can its benefits continue indefinitely?  This question is taken on by GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair, who weighs the pros and cons of  globalisation in the 21st century.  Chandran Nair:  It is very important to also recognise the benefits that globalisation has brought about. Many in  Asia and elsewhere are more prosperous than ever. I remember going to Beijing only 30 years  ago and hardly seeing many cars and most people in bicycles et cetera. And today, if you go to  China, the transformation has been tremendous. Much of that has been brought about as China  opened its doors, joined the WTO, that organisation that essentially propels and urges countries  to globalise through cooperative rules et cetera. And China changed tremendously.  But it was not just China. It was all across Southeast Asia, in different parts of the Middle East,  from the UAE, right through to different parts of North Africa and across Africa too.  In Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, these impacts have been profound in a very short  space of time. We often talk about globalisation and the impacts of globalisation on a large  country   of   China,   which   has   been   the   story   for the last 30 years. But the impacts of  globalisation, both positive and negative, were felt right across the world.  I used to live in Africa about 30 years ago, and Africa today is very different from the Africa that I  knew. But what is very clear is that today in Africa, in urban areas et cetera, there are advances  
that one couldn't have imagined 40 - 50 years ago. And much of that came about through  Africa's integration into the global economy, through globalisation. The same can be said of  Latin America, and many parts of the Middle East. People's standards of living in different parts  of those regions were raised enormously through globalisation and integration of global  economies.  So, let me leave you with this thought. Globalisation cannot be stopped. One of the best  descriptions of globalisation was offered by the former Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan.  He said, “It has been said that arguing against globalisation is like arguing against the laws of  gravity.” And he is absolutely right. People have been globalising for hundreds and hundreds of  years. The question we are confronted with, as the human population peaks at 10 billion, and as  we are confronted with existential threats, many of which are man-made and therefore cannot  be separated from the process of globalisation – and this is an important recognition that  cannot be separated from the process of globalisation.  The   question   is   -   How   do   we   manage   this   process   of   globalisation?   It's   not   about  de-globalisation or more globalisation. It is: What does better globalisation look like? Why and  how can globalisation be made better? And that is essentially the big challenge of redesigning  society.  Rohan Hazell:  Many countries have witnessed massive progress in the last 50 years thanks to globalisation.  Advancements that couldn’t even be imagined 100 years ago. But the prosperity that advocates  of globalisation have long promised remains elusive for many of the global majority.  Clearly,   globalisation   cannot   be   stopped.   The   challenge,   therefore,   lies   not   in reversing  globalisation, but in managing and improving it to address its downsides while maintaining its  benefits.

Making Sense of the Economy: Introduction to the Doughnut

### keyTakeaway
This chapter challenged conventional economic models, advocating for a shift towards a 21st-century understanding where the economy serves both humanity and the planet, as visualised in the concept of the "Doughnut." The economy's purpose extends beyond GDP growth and market focus, aiming instead to manage our "planetary household" to benefit all inhabitants and the planet itself. The Doughnut model presents a balanced approach to meeting human needs within ecological limits, aligning with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for global prosperity. The Doughnut challenges the Western growth-centric mindset, drawing on indigenous and other cultural perspectives that emphasise balance and thriving within environmental limits.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Making Sense of the Economy: Introduction to the Doughnut  Rohan Hazell:  What comes to mind when you think of the economy? Where did the idea of an economy even  come from? What purpose do you think it serves?  Most of us take its existence for granted. We accept at face value the notion that the economy  is driven by market forces and that state intervention is unnecessary or even counterproductive  to growth. But is this actually the case?  We’ll address these questions with Kate Raworth, an economist from Oxford University and  author of the acclaimed book Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century  Economist.  She unpacks the purpose of the economy, and explains why and how we must be proactive in  designing economies that prioritise the wellbeing of people and the planet.  Kate Raworth:  What is the purpose of the economy? You know what? I wish this question had even been  asked when I was a student, because I will tell you that the world over, when people study  economics, this question doesn't get discussed. It's barely a topic. But it's   the most important  question, because if we don't know what we think the purpose of the economy is, how on earth  will we know what we think success looks like?  So let's go back to the ancient Greek roots of the word economics. It actually comes from two  Greek words, Oikos, which means household, and Nomos, which means the management of, or  the norms of something. So the norms of the household. The management of t he household.  Now, in the 21st century, when we are so profoundly interconnected on this living planet, the  household is surely our planetary household. And so the management of our planetary  household, in the interest of all her inhabitants, humanity and   surely the rest of life.  To me, that is 21st century economics. In lecture theatres the world over, students gather for  their first lecture in economics. And to me, it's a really fascinating question. What is the first
  concept that they encounter? Surely it would be, what is the purpose of economics and of the  economy? But, you know, it isn't. In fact, I would ask anybody watching this, if you've ever  studied economics in any form, what's the first diagram that comes to   mind? I tell you, it's the  same the world over. It's supply and demand.  I have asked hundreds of roomfuls of students, what's the first diagram you remember  learning? And they all chant as if they'd pre - planned the answer: Supply and demand. This is a  diagram about the market, the supply of goods in the market and the customer s demanding it.  And it criss - crosses at a point where that makes the price of the product. Now, it's a useful  model in some ways, but it's very strange to me that this is where we begin, because when we  begin here, we're totally focused all of a sudden on   markets, as if the economy is the market.  No, it's many, many other things beyond that. But we've gone and put all of our attention on  the market. It puts price at the centre of our concerns. Suddenly this is the metric we're talking  about, price, and it means anything that falls outside of market   transactions is called an  externality, and we can come back to that later. Now, when we start with markets, well, what  would it mean for a market to succeed? What's the purpose? It's a very quick pathway to saying  that the purpose is growth and success wi ll be GDP growth, markets producing more and more  economic value, and so success is surely an ever rising GDP.  Hear that purpose spoken in the speeches of politicians. The world's over. We can hear it in the  lectures from economics professors. It's implicit, and I believe this is just a completely  inadequate concept as the goal for the purpose of the economy. I wou ld love economics  lectures the world over to start with a very different question to start with the doughnut, which  I'm going to introduce to you now. What kind of economy would bring humanity into the  doughnut? A space where we meet the needs of all peopl e within the means of the living  planet. That is what I think is the purpose of the economy and the meaning of 21st century  household management.  So let me introduce you to the one doughnut that actually turns out to be good for us. Think of  it as a compass for human prosperity in the 21st century. Now, what's going on here? Imagine  humanity's use of earth's resources radiating out from the centre o f that picture. So the hole in  the middle of the doughnut is a place where people are falling short on the essentials of life. It's  a place where people do not have the resources they need for good food and decent housing  and healthcare, and a good educati on, transport connections, income, equity, political voice.  It's a place where people are falling short. And the power of this is that these twelve
  dimensions, I crowdsourced them from the world's governments. They are the social  dimensions set out in the sustainable development goals.  The power of that is that all the governments in the world have already agreed that every  person in the world has a claim to meeting these essentials. Leave nobody falling short, leave  no one in the hole. First step now we know that as we aim to use Earth' s resources to meet  these essential needs and many wants beyond them, we start converting forests into timber.  We extract fish from the sea. We emit carbon emissions into the atmosphere. We convert land  for food and materials, we build on the earth for cit ies, and we start putting pressure on the life  supporting systems of our planetary home.  Our emissions start creating climate change and they acidify the oceans. We convert so much  land that we begin to lose biodiversity. We withdraw so much water from the lakes and rivers,  we start to drain them dry. We create so much plastic waste that we ar e polluting with  microplastics that go into the web of life. So around the edge of this is an ecological ceiling  beyond which we should not go, because these are the life supporting systems of our planetary  home. And these nine ecological dimensions come f rom the concept of planetary boundaries  created just over a decade ago by Earth system scientists, who said, these are the life support  systems of this unique and delicately balanced living planet in the universe.  We'd be crazy to overshoot our pressure on this planet. So let's put these together, leave no  one in the hole, but don't overshoot the limits. We need to meet the needs of all people within  the means of the living planet. So we want to thrive in that green   donut space in between. It's  an ecologically safe and socially just space for humanity. That is the vision of the Doughnut and  I offer it as a compass for human prosperity.  Let me add that when I drew this first in 2012, just over a decade ago, I was amazed by the  response that it got. I was amazed by how many people were excited, empowered and  mobilised by it. And I started to ask myself about the power of pictures. And then   I looked at  the way that many other cultures, away from the western mindset, had for millennia, depicted  their vision of health, of wealth, of well being. And I was astounded and humbled to see that  other cultures, indigenous cultures, have long, long kno wn that this shape of a dynamic circle,  it's circular, and there's some sort of dynamism within that has been used as a symbol of well  being and health and thriving across the world. So suddenly you realise that it's actually the  western economic mindset t hat is the outlier. It's only the western mindset that has thought  that growth endlessly is somehow a good shape of progress.
  And I ask myself whether the doughnut can be like a recovery programme from this mindset of  endless growth. Can we, through the doughnut, start moving towards the wisdom that has long  been held in these other cultural views? Can we learn from them? Can we   create our own  pathway back to that much deeper sense of thriving, rather than endlessly growing? So that is  the Doughnut and its goal of transformation.  Rohan Hazell:  Economic development has become synonymous with growth at all costs, but it has also  become clear that this is unsustainable and nor does growth for growth's sake reflect the true  purpose of the economy.  Instead, Kate Raworth suggests that we must design and develop economies that sustainably  manage the Earth's resources to provide basic needs for all while remaining within our  planetary boundaries. That is, to ensure that humanity lives and thrives within   the Doughnut.

The World in the 20th Century 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair provided a comprehensive overview of the significant historical events and shifts of the 20th century that shaped modern-day globalisation.The 1900s witnessed the exploitation of cheap resources by European colonies across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, fueling prosperity in the West. This era also saw the rise of settler communities in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. These events ultimately culminated in two world wars, centred around European conflicts to dominate resources and labour.The end of World War II resulted in the Bretton Woods Agreement, establishing today's modern financial system, centered around the US dollar as the reserve currency.In the 1950s decolonisation became a global phenomenon, which spread rapidly across regions from Africa to Southeast Asia, leading to the liberation of many countries.The collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century marked the end of competing political ideologies and the rise of democratic societies. However, the expectation that democracy’s spread would result in universal stability and peace has proved more complex than anticipated.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The World in the 20th Century  Rohan Hazell:  Globalisation is an ongoing process of economic and cultural integration that shapes the world  we know today.  And much of modern day globalisation has its roots in the major events of the 20th century.  What are these events and why are they important? To answer these questions, you’ll hear  from GIFT.ed Chairman, Chandran Nair.  Chandran Nair:  The 1900s was marked by what is called the age of manufacturing and the creation of what is  known today as the financial systems using cheap and abundant resources from European  colonies. Many European and advanced nations exploited these resources in Africa, Asia, and  the Americas to sustain prosperity in the West.  This is also the time where settler communities essentially in North America, the United States,  Canada, and in Australia and New Zealand essentially were created out of nothing using cheap  and abundant resources and the migration of populations from the centre in Europe to  essentially colonise these underpopulated and almost defenceless societies in these parts of the  world.  All of these then eventually resulted in winner-takes-all wars in World War I and World War II,  which is basically centred around European conflicts to dominate parts of the world and to  dominate the resources and the labour that were central to wealth creation.  The end of the Second World War resulted in something called the Bretton Woods Agreement,  which created what is today's modern day financial system, which depended on the US dollar  as a foreign reserve. After 60 - 70 years of that, the world is at a point where there are many  questions being asked about how long will the US dollar remain the reserve currency and allow  
the Americans the exorbitant privilege of having the dollars of reserve currency, which no other  country enjoys.  In the 1950s, decolonisation began to spread throughout the world as communities around the  world realised that they had been oppressed for too long and wanted self-determination. This  spread like wildfire, and over the 50s, 60s, and 70s, many countries were liberated, from Africa  to India, to the Middle East, right through to Southeast Asia, where many wars were fought to  essentially decolonize many parts of the world that continued even into the 90s, with the end of  apartheid in Africa, and even till about 25 years ago, when the colony of Hong Kong was handed  back to China. So that period sort of was almost at an end now.  At the end of the 20 th   century, we saw the end of the division of power by political ideologies,  the end of the Cold War in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. We also saw the  dominance of the US and the rise of democratic societies. The notion that democracy would  spread, and it would essentially bring about a more stable, a more peaceful world. Today, as we  look around in 2022, we realise that these were nice aspirations, but actually, the world is a lot  more complex than that. And these are not ideas that essentially were being embraced right  across the planet.  The rise of China, which is probably the most significant political and economic story of the last  30 years, began to challenge the idea that only Western political ideological beliefs can be the  basis for creating prosperity and peaceful societies. Today, that tension is being seen in the  conflict between the United States and China. The Middle East continues to be in turmoil with  the illegal invasion of Iraq and subsequent turmoil in Turkey in Libya, in Syria and, and other  parts.  It was also the era in which the arrival, computers, the Internet, and smartphones essentially  changed life for human beings forever, and it became widely known as the age of the internet.  We moved from the Industrial Revolution 2.0 to Industrial Revolution 3.0, which is the age of  the computer.  Rohan Hazell:  The   20 th   century   was   characterised   by   rapid   development   resulting   from industrial and  technological   advances.   Many   colonised   countries also saw the return of independence,  allowing more nations to participate on the global stage. These advances have paved the way  for accelerated global growth and the geopolitical norms we see today.

Managing Stakeholder Expectations

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the need to transparently communicate the associated risks and rewards of integrating sustainability into business activities when attempting to gain stakeholder support.All of a business' stakeholders have a vested interest in its success, and so companies must be able to articulate how an action furthers the interests of each stakeholder. Clear communication and consistent engagement with stakeholders across the board are a must for aligning expectations and gaining support for decisions to embed sustainability into the business model.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Managing Stakeholder Expectations  Elaine Fernandez:  Stakeholders are not always going to be on the same page as each has their own unique risk  tolerances, objectives and motivations. So the question is, how exactly can a business manage  its   stakeholder   expectations   as   its   strategies   and   approaches   evolve?   Richard Lancaster,  Executive Director and former Chief Executive Officer of CLP holdings, one of the largest private  power producers in the Asia-Pacific region, shares his views on how to effectively manage  stakeholder expectations and relationships.  Richard Lancaster:  The investor journey is really important. You need as a company to align yourself with the  objectives of your investors. At the time we started this journey, we were investing in coal-fired  power production. Now, that was a very proven technology. It was well understood. Asia, where  we operate, had plenty of reserves of coal and it was a proven model, relatively low risk and  relatively well understood. What we needed to persuade our investors was that we were going  to gradually move away from that. We're going to abandon that and move to something called  renewable energy, which is a brand new technology, high cost, uncompetitive, and high risk.  And you can imagine the conversations that we had around this, why on earth are you doing  this? And all of those conversations had to be around, well, we are heavily exposed with coal to  a risk, a business risk, and we needed to explain that risk. We needed to quantify that. We  needed to say that we will have a risk from regulatory perspectives, we will have political risk,  we'll risk moving away from societal objectives, we'll have to struggle financing these assets,  and therefore we need to be a fast mover to adapt and absorb these new technologies into our  business.  So when we approached that conversation in the right way, we were given a little bit of leeway  to make progress. We needed to show that the investments we were making were profitable,  that the risks were understood, that we could manage those and we could see those as viable  businesses. And then over time, more and more companies started to change. And so we  
started to be seen as this is a sensible transition. And now the conversations we have are, why  can't you move faster? Why can't you build more renewable energy? Why can't you shut down  those coal plants more quickly? So it's been interesting to see how those conversations have  changed over the 13 years that we've, we've been having them.  Well, I think the key thing to keep in mind is alignment. You need to create alignment.  Alignment with your shareholders, with your regulators, with your customers. And the way you  achieve   alignment   is   through good communication. So investing and taking the time to  communicate well and clearly is really important. But alignment is also important.  We have joined up with other like-minded utilities at quite an early stage so that we could speak  with a greater voice. And through organisations such as the World Business Council for  Sustainable Development, we were able to speak on behalf of leading companies and to be  seen as a company that's moving in line with others, so that you're not seen as an outlier in all  of this. So creating alignment is really important. Alignment with your peers, alignment with  your stakeholders, and alignment within your organisation as well, so that you're speaking with  one clear, consistent voice.  The issues that we're facing are much more pressing. I think we understand them better. I think  there's more information available for societies generally and for stakeholders to understand  how businesses are currently either contributing or not contributing to societal aims. I think the  whole sustainability conversation that we're having is making people more aware. Whether it's  inside the business or outside the business, people are more aware of the issues, of the  impacts. And these conversations are starting to really elevate up into boardrooms and  executive leadership teams. So people are starting to understand and be able to have a more  intelligent and more meaningful conversation around these issues, whether it's climate change,  waste, air pollution, whatever.  I talked about the importance of alignment and it isn't always possible to bring everyone into  alignment, but to bring alignment around a plan or a target or a pathway is certainly possible.  When we talk about decarbonisation, we will have stakeholders that say where we're moving  way too slowly, that we need to decarbonise. It's an urgent issue and we need to be out of coal  tomorrow and have developed everything renewable energy by the day after.  Now, we can't meet that expectation. We also have stakeholders that say, hold on, you can't  move too quickly here. You need to move at an appropriate pace. And maybe they question  how quickly we're moving. So there needs to be something that brings us together. What we  
have done is adopted the IPCC pathway. As I mentioned earlier, the science-based target profile  is something which we can say is based on science. It is what is required societally for us to  meet a well below two degrees decarbonisation, global warming stabilisation target. And we  can argue that that is the right pace for us now. That won't satisfy all of our stakeholders, but it  is a statement that we're making.  This is the pace at which we are moving. If there are investors that don't feel that that's right,  they may choose to invest elsewhere. But I can also say to them that we need investment  money to achieve this target. It is what we think is the right piece. And if you're not there to  help us and support us, it is going to slow us down even further. And I can also say to those  investors that might think we're moving too quickly, well, we are dealing with risks here, and  we're dealing with them in the best way that we can. And again, we need you to support us  because what we think is this is the optimum level of risk for our business.  So it does enable you to bring stakeholders together if you can communicate a clear transition  plan or a clear way of achieving that objective and explain all the implications. And I think that is  really crucial. It's not an alignment around getting everybody in a consensus. It's around, this is  what we are going to do, and this is why we're going to do it.  Elaine Fernandez:  Ultimately, all of our business stakeholders have a vested interest in its success, and so  companies must be able to articulate how an action furthers the interests of each stakeholder.  Clear communication and consistent engagement with stakeholders across the board are a must  for aligning expectations and gaining support for efforts to integrate sustainability into all  business activities.

Operation and Ownership: Society is Reacting to "Business-As-Usual"

### keyTakeaway
This chapter explored the evolving nature of business practices, highlighting societal reactions to traditional business models, the consequences of speculative financial behaviour, and the need for a more equitable approach to considering stakeholders in business decisions.The transient and speculative behaviour of many shareholders challenges traditional notions of business ownership and corporate governance.Employees and other stakeholders, despite their commitment and contributions to a business, often lack a say in decision-making and profit distribution, overshadowed by transient shareholders.Society is increasingly challenging "business-as-usual" practices, which, if unadapted, risk future viability due to their lack of preparedness for shocks like the pandemic.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Operation and Ownership:  Society is Reacting to “Business-As-Usual”  Elaine Fernandez:  How a business operates and who it is owned by is far from static. One of the recent pressures  changing these two factors is how society perceives them. Business operations are increasingly  being scrutinised, while there are calls for business ownership to become more democratised.  To   find   out, we'll hear from Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global Institute for  Tomorrow.  Eric Stryson:  So in a way, we can say that society is reacting to, quote unquote, business as usual. And if we  continue to rely on the business models that we always have, and continue to push business as  usual without adapting, society will continue to react and may ensure that those business  models are not viable in the future.  It's interesting to appreciate that in advance of the pandemic in 2019, the 30 largest global  banks distributed somewhere in the order of $250 billion in dividends and buybacks. And this  focus on share price has left many of them, not just the banks, but other businesses as well,  unprepared for the shocks that came through the pandemic. It has jeopardised workers'  livelihoods because the businesses had not saved for a rainy day, they had not prepared for the  shocks that would come through the pandemic and through the lockdowns. And they were  forced to make many of their staff redundant because that's the only thing they could do. So  this is very much business-as-usual thinking and business-as-usual acting.  I think the speculative markets in housing have left many populations priced out and vulnerable  to shocks. If we want a resilient society, we need to appreciate that having a safe, secure and  affordable place to live is not only a basic human right, but is a fundamental protection against  the shocks. The avoidance of paying tax has been considered an abuse of human rights by the  International Bar Association. The tax avoidance as a phenomenon has, in the aggregate,  
hollowed out public services, and it has left governments unprepared to invest in the public  services that would keep their societies resilient and that would work to improve their quality of  life.  Let's remember, business is part of society, and it is society who sets the rules, both formally,  through the government and through that licence to operate, but also through the informal  channels of how individuals and groups within civil society respond to business, and whether  they support a business or whether they reject a business.  So how do we really understand the nature of business ownership in society? Usually, we  assume that it is the shareholders or the owners of stock who own the business. But the  contradiction is that many shareholders typically do not behave like owners. They are transient,  they are anonymous and they move in and out of their ownership of a stock at whim. And  viewed by society, these transient shareholders really should be considered investors - yes. But  many of them are speculators or even gamblers. And I think over the last year or so, we have  seen many examples of speculative, extreme speculative, even gambling type activity in the  stock market and at the same time, stakeholders like the employees who are arguably much  more committed to the success of the business. Those stakeholders rarely have a say in  decision-making. Again, despite the indispensable role that they play, despite their loyalty and  commitment, they are not given priority over claims for the corporate profit. They will be lucky  if they get a bonus, if they have their working conditions improved through reinvestment in the  business, or if they enjoy other fruits of the business. But they do not have a direct say, typically  in the disbursement of corporate profit. The non-financial capital inputs into the business, and  by that I mean things like human capital, the social capital, and the natural capital which are  essential to a successful business. These non-financial capital inputs are typically not valued  equally in the current business ownership structures that we rely upon.  It's interesting to note that the average holding period for public company shares has declined  from about 5.1 years back in 1976 to under seven months today. And so, given that the average  holding period of public shares has declined so dramatically, we can see that shareholders are  not acting the way they used to act and therefore we should consider them differently in  relation to other stakeholders in the business.  Elaine Fernandez:  Society is increasingly questioning the norms of business operation and ownership for being  unfair or ineffective. This is not a universal interpretation, but it does raise questions about how  
businesses pay tax, how employees contribute to the company's decision-making, and how  non-financial resources are valued by the private sector. Business ownership is complex and it  increasingly needs to benefit consumers, employees and society at large.

Culture & Leadership: When East Meets West

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong discussed the importance of cultural integration in business, drawing from his experiences at Alibaba to highlight how embracing diverse perspectives can lead to global success.Culture shapes how we interact, communicate, and collaborate in all contexts, including business. Understanding and integrating diverse cultural perspectives can foster innovation, build stronger teams, and create a more inclusive and effective organisation in an increasingly plural world.Often, learning how to navigate new cultural contexts requires us to first unlearn many preconceived notions that we harbour, as exemplified by Brian Wong's experience of adapting to a predominantly Chinese business environment while working at Alibaba.Effective leadership starts with self-awareness: understanding your own strengths, weaknesses, and fears, as this makes it easier to understand and collaborate with others, thereby promoting a culture of mutual respect.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Culture & Leadership: When East Meets West  Host:  When we hear the word “culture,” we’re quick to think of art, music, and traditions. But culture  encompasses much more than that. In a business context, culture shapes how we interact,  communicate, and collaborate.   It influences our values, our behaviour s, and ultimately, our  success.  In   an   increasingly   interconnected   world,   understanding   and   integrating   diverse   cultural  perspectives becomes crucial for business leaders.  Why? Because leveraging those   differences can   foster innovation, build stronger teams, and  create a more inclusive and effective organisation.  To learn more about the profound impact of cultural integration in business, let’s now hear from  Brian Wong, former Special Assistant to the Chairman of Alibaba Group and author of the  bestselling book “The Tao of Alibaba”.  Brian will tell us about his personal journey at Alibaba, and how embracing and understanding  cultural nuances was key to the company's global success.  Brian A. Wong:  I think the experience I had at Alibaba was very humbling because as someone who grew up in  the States, you know, I have Chinese heritage, but I'm very American. My parents were born in  America,   and I thought that growing up in Silicon Valley, it was just as simple as speaking a little  bit of the local language and then bringing the Silicon Valley model to, say, China and then  working with these companies there.  But what you realise is that it's far more complicated than that.  There are cultural aspects that influence how businesses run, how you communicate with your  colleagues, but also how you serve a market. And I think, for me, what was humbling is, even
  though I had a good education, learned the basic business principles in business school and went  back to the company, there was a lot of stuff I had to unlearn.  And I think that what is so important for anyone that's trying to understand this is to immerse  yourself and kind of come in as a blank slate to understand how the local culture operates and  then take. Try and take the best of what you have and integrate i t with the best of what is there  on the ground.  And I think the same is true with your staff, like allowing them to be able to understand your  world or your markets, right? So that there's this mutual understanding and mutual respect. It's  not easy, but I think that once you can find that overlap, it co uld be very effective and very  impactful.  Jack Ma, our founder, was able to meld both because he actually spent time early in his life in  Australia at a time when most people couldn't leave China. That opened his mind to the whole  western thinking. And then he came back to China and set up Alibaba . But he wanted it to be a  global business that was founded in China so he brought in a lot of international people to the  company. I think the bigger challenge was not Jack and his leadership, but it was the people  within the organisation and their willin gness to kind of embrace both sides.  It was not just foreigners who came to China and thought, the best way is the American way or  the European way, but it was also the Chinese team that worked with the international people  and thought, well, this worked in China, so it should work in India o r should work in the US. And  that is really a mindset shift where you have to be open to one another and have mutual respect.  I think the unlearning comes from understanding the presumptions that are underlying the  conclusion and also understanding the cultural context that shapes why people in a local market  act a certain way or talk a certain way, but then understanding why you   also react to those things  in a certain way.  I always think, though, it has to start with yourself, in understanding yourself and why you believe  certain things or why you act in a certain way, and then it becomes much easier to decipher the  counter party. And so that's what we talked about incessant ly at Alibaba, is kind of leadership  starts with understanding yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses, your fears, and then that  will make it much easier to interact with others.
  It was humbling for me because I thought that when I went to business school, I'd have it all there  in my bulk packs and I come to the office and I say, this is how it's done. My professor said this,  but then you realise that the professors themselves didn 't have all the answers and some of them  were teaching things from just visiting, say, a market. I remember my China management  professor, he'd visited China maybe like five times in the last three years, and he was lecturing us  on how Chinese corporations   are run. And it was far different from my experience. And so you  realise that sometimes what you learn in school is only part of the truth as well.  And you have to dig deep within yourself to find the answers that you are comfortable with. And  that aspect of it is the intuition which   you need to lean on as a business leader.  Host:  Brian’s journey at Alibaba underscores the importance of cultural integration and mutual respect  in building a successful global business.  Given his American upbringing and education, Brian had to unlearn many preconceived notions  to adapt to the Chinese business environment effectively. This highlights the value of immersing  oneself in local cultures to bridge gaps and foster a collaborative   atmosphere.

The Case for Understanding Other Political Systems

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Daniel Bell challenged the simplistic division of the world into democracies and autocracies, advocating instead for a nuanced understanding of diverse political systems. Professor Bell criticises the assumption in the West that electoral democracy is the only legitimate form of governance, emphasising the need for pluralism in understanding political systems. He suggests setting aside biases to appreciate the variety of legitimate ways to select public officials, appreciating the advantages and disadvantages of each in the context of each nation’s political culture, sizes, and needs. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Case for Understanding Other Political Systems  Elaine Fernandez:  Which political system a country uses is often a source of great judgement, especially as the  variety of political systems in the world are often categorised into democratic and autocratic.  However, Professor Daniel Bell, Chair of Political Theory at the University of Hong Kong Faculty  of Law, challenges this bipolar way of looking at political systems.  He stresses the importance of setting aside biases to understand and appreciate plural ways of  selecting public officials, which can help foster a more nuanced and inclusive perspective on  global political systems.  Professor Daniel Bell:  He stresses the importance of setting aside biases to understand and appreciate plural ways of  selecting public officials, which can help foster a more nuanced and inclusive perspective on  global political systems. It's not just about the liberal democrati c West and China. There   are   so  many countries around the world where there's perhaps more willingness to engage in political  experimentation.  Even at Shandong University, where I used to be, we had public officials, not high - level  bureaucrats from countries like Ethiopia or Laos, that were very open to learning from the  meritocratic aspects of the political system while also being committed to s ome kind of  democracy. I think I have much more hope for countries that are less dogmatically committed to,  let's call it electoral democratic norms in the rest of the world.  I'm not in favour of dividing the world between so called democracies and   so - called   autocracies.  I mean, it's such a vulgar and misleading way of thinking of the world. If you don't select your  leaders by means of elections, it means you’re an autocracy. But that's so crazy. I mean, there's  such a diversity of political systems that don' t use elections to select top leaders. I mean, China,  at least in principle, is kind of political.
  You have countries that are family run dictatorships, like North Korea. You have countries that  are military dictatorships, you know, like if you want to use that word, like in Myanmar. I mean,  to lump all those countries together is just totally misleadin g. So when it comes to understanding  political systems, it's very important to leave aside the kind of values that one has learned,  especially for those of us from the West, from the kind of mother's milk, literally.  There's just this unquestioned dogmatic assumption, which again, is relatively new   post - World  War II, that the only legitimate way of selecting political leaders, regardless of the country's  political culture, regardless of the size of the country, regardless of the urgent needs of the  country, it's one person, one vote. I mean, that's just very,   very dogmatic and not shared in much  of the rest of the world. So to understand political systems first requires setting aside one's biases  to the extent possible, and being more open to the possibility that there are plural ways of  selecting public offici als and plural ways, legitimate ways of selecting public officials.  And that each system is going to have its advantages and disadvantages. But we need to first set  aside our biases to understand those political systems again, while maintaining commitment to  basic human rights. You know, fine, no torture, no slavery, no mu rder of innocence, provide for  the basic material needs of the people. But beyond that, when it comes to understanding a  political system or how leaders should be selected, we need to have pluralism. That's the most  important message, especially relevant f or the West, where there's such a dogmatic view about  the legitimate way of selecting leaders.  Elaine Fernandez:  Professor Bell leaves us with a reflection on the need for an open mind when seeking to  understand other political systems. After all, political diversity is the reality of our world.  Whatever form they take, political systems must be flexible and agile enough to experiment and  innovate to deliver the best possible results to society at large.

Unleashing Potential: Igniting Purpose

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned about the importance of personal and professional purpose. A sense of purpose is integral to our overall sense of meaning and fulfilment in life. They extend beyond day-to-day tasks and encompass broader beliefs and missions.To discover and clarify your purpose, regular reflection is essential. The Purpose Mapping tool developed by the Global Institute for Tomorrow can help you gain a deeper understanding of what drives you in various aspects of your life.In the personal sphere, purpose reflects your personal aspirations, such as improving your quality of life, advancing your career, or caring for loved ones. Purpose in this context can significantly impact your ability to achieve these goals.In the workplace, purpose is evident in your sense of ownership, dedication to colleagues and projects, and belief in creating value beyond your job security. Finding meaning in your work is crucial for fulfilment and resilience, especially considering the time and energy spent on your career.Your sense of purpose may evolve over time as you transition through different life stages. It's a dynamic and iterative process that requires ongoing self-reflection.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Unleashing Potential: Igniting Purpose  Rohan Hazell:  Upon first learning about concepts like Redesigning Society and Insured Resilience, they can  seem disconnected from our day-to-day lives. But the reality is we all play a role in contributing  to the health, wellbeing, and success of our communities and organisations. So we all have the  potential to bring about positive change.  This potential can only be unleashed when we align our personal and professional goals with a  broader or higher mission. Your GIFT.ed learning journey will help you to ignite or reignite your  sense   of   purpose,   cultivate   and apply critical thinking with a newfound strategic global  awareness, and translate your ideas for positive change into action.  Without a sense of purpose, it can feel like we're just going through the motions, checking the  boxes in our life and work. An absence of purpose gives rise to a sense that we're always striving  to achieve outcomes. But without ever really being sure why. Purpose, in essence, refers to  something that extends beyond day to day life, or professional success.  For individuals, it often means being driven by a belief in something that is broader than our  narrow self interest. At an organisational level, it is an awareness of what greater mission is  being served through our contributions at work, and how our personal purpose aligns with the  higher purpose of our organisation.  Purpose gives meaning to what we do; at home, in our communities, and in the workplace. It  evolves as we transition through different stages of life. So identifying and clarifying our  purpose is an important and iterative process that we should all engage in from time to time.  One of the most effective ways to do this is through regular reflection by taking some time to  consider our whys and think deeply about what motivates us across the various spheres of our  lives.  Enter the purpose mapping tool, developed by the Global Institute for Tomorrow, a framework  to help you clarify the meaning you derive from the personal, professional, social, and public  spheres of influence that constitute your life.  
The rest of this chapter, and the next, will help you complete your own purpose map, get an  understanding of what drives you and articulate what you want to achieve through your GIFT.ed  learning journey. You can find the purpose map tool on this page. We'll begin with the first two  spheres of influence: personal and professional.  In the personal sphere, the purpose we derive is reflected in our personal aspirations. Whether  it is a commitment to improve our quality of life, progress in our careers, ensure we spend  enough time with our children or care for our parents in the sunset of their lives. Understanding  our why can mean the difference in whether or not we are able to follow through on our  aspirations.  Maryam Al Mansoori:  I used to always try to not use too much tap water at home. Funny enough, I picked that up at  the Global Leaders Program from GIFT, which I was a proud alumnus. We went to one of the  hotels, I think it was in Puna, where they told us you only have one minute to shower. The  second you turn the shower on, and then in a minute, you know, the water runs out, and you're  stuck with that.  So I came to pick up the value of water back in India through the GLP, and that's when I started  implementing more life conscious personal decisions starting from my house. So pushing my  parents and siblings as well in terms of valuing the natural resources, switching to more  sustainable and economically friendly products.  I also started to realise that the fashion industry was picking up on sustainability. So whenever  there were any shopping decisions to be made, we'd look at the brand and how it would  manufacture its goods, et cetera, the carbon footprint related to it. And naturally it became  embedded in what I wanted to do on a daily basis.  Rohan Hazell:  In the workplace, purpose can be seen in our sense of ownership and accountability, dedication  to our colleagues and projects, and a belief that our work is creating real value beyond our  salary and job security. Given how much of our time and energy is spent on our careers, finding  meaning in the work we do is critical to our sense of fulfilment and happiness.  
Whether we are driven by empowering or mentoring the next generation, striving for excellence  in everything we do, or by ensuring our organisation has a positive impact on the environment  and society, These motivations direct our choices and behaviours. and help us stay the course to  build resilience during times of adversity.  Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan:  I mean, the problem I've always wanted to solve, at least for the last 30 plus years, has been  ensuring that decent work is there and people have livelihoods. I think over the years, I have  changed my mind often on what livelihood means. Initially, it was education and work. Now, as I  said, it's education, work, and adjacencies.  So at all points the mission has remained the same. Saying where I want to drive is to ensure  that people are able to get a steady income and their learning and earning curves don't stop,  you know. India had a unique thing that, you know, you can only finish things in this age group  and not further.  How do you change that language? And that has also happened for external factors, but it's  helped us, and helped me particularly in thinking where you go. From an entity perspective also,  I've seen, you know, I've gone 360 degrees. I started as a researcher, then a bit of an activist,  then in policy with ILO, then as a not-for-profit and then as a for profit organisation.  So as a social enterprise. So, to me, the entity and the structure by which it defines it is not  determining the outcome. The outcome needs to be accompanied, accomplished, and therefore  you need various types of entities. So I've used entity, social enterprise and not-for-profit policy  as the tool for me to reach the outcome that I need.  So the enabler for me is the entity, but not the outcomes. So, the social enterprise succeeding is  very   important,   but   the   social   enterprise   succeeding   for   what   is   more   important.   The  not-for-profit working is important because the adjacencies have to be in the not-for-profit. But  for what?  Again, it is for the same purpose. So that's the way in which I think the newer forms that I have  learned over the years have helped me drive closer to the outcome which is the mission of  ensuring people's livelihoods are enabled.  
Rohan Hazell:  Take some time to reflect on your sense of purpose in the personal and professional spheres  before you move on to the final chapter, in which we'll broaden the discussion of purpose to the  social and public spheres.

Bold Business Leadership: Innovating to Remain Competitive

### keyTakeaway
In a rapidly evolving world marked by technological advancements, climate change, and social challenges, businesses face the imperative to innovate and adapt their models to remain relevant, addressing pressing global needs while embracing new technologies for sustainable solutions.Future business relevance depends on leadership in developing new business models and products that address critical social needs, such as providing safe housing and effective waste management to billions globally.Emerging technologies, including digital tools and precision agriculture, offer transformative solutions for environmental and social challenges, extending beyond conventional digital applications.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Bold Business Leadership:  Innovating to Remain Competitive  Elaine Fernandez:  Businesses   face   unprecedented   challenges   as   social   contracts   around   the   world   evolve.  Consumers, government and society at large expect companies to create more social value and  contribute to a societal redesign. But how? As Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global  Institute for Tomorrow explores in this chapter, how leadership responds and adapts to these  shifting stakeholder expectations will determine the company's future success and ability to  retain its licence to operate.  Eric Stryson:  So I think the question we really need to consider is how business remains relevant in a complex  and rapidly changing world. So it really takes leadership and individual action around bold,  innovative new ideas and business models. So it's important to recognise innovation is not  simply a new app or a new website or a new gadget that we seek to market to consumers.  Innovation is actually fundamentally changing business models, changing products and services  in response to changing demands, the demands of a changing climate, the demands for healthy,  high quality of life amidst a technology landscape which we've never experienced before.  So what would that innovation look like? I think much of the innovation in business will come in  response to pressing social needs. And business leaders therefore need to be ever more aware  of the realities on the ground in different parts of the world. Billions of people still need access  to basic living standards, basic resources meeting their basic needs, their basic human rights.  The UN-Habitat estimates that up to 3 billion people still need access to safe, secure housing by  2030. Up to 3 billion people still lack access to basic waste collection. Imagine living without  proper waste collection services and what that means for lifestyle in communities.  This also presents business opportunities. We talked about the plastic waste challenge and well,  3   billion   people   lack   access   to   consistent   waste   collection, including waste sorting and  
separation. So is your business positioning itself to capture these opportunities? So if we look at  the issue of housing and sanitation as one example of basic needs that are not yet being met at  the scale that we need it to be met, it's really impossible to provide a Western style housing  structure to the 3 billion people who still require it. There's not enough land and space and  materials to build, so we will need new innovative materials, material science, new business  models to deploy prefabricated houses, for instance. And frankly, we don't have enough water  for everybody on the planet to have the flush toilets that we take for granted in many advanced  economies. They need toilets, they need sanitation. But we will need new models for innovative  waterless toilets that provide all the benefits of sanitation, but without using all the water that  our traditional toilets use.  How will businesses provide for these needs in an increasingly resource-constrained world?  That is a question which we should all be asking ourselves and that will be the seed for the  innovation in the years to come. Technology is a problem-solving tool, and it's an application of  scientific knowledge in practice in order to solve a problem. And yet, the new digital technology  world that we find ourselves in will also drive a lot of new innovation, and we should consider  how to apply that to the problems that we need to solve. So technology offers vast new  possibilities. Some of it will transform how we live, work and conduct our businesses. But not all  technology is digital, and not all digital are simply smartphone apps.  So one example that we like to cite around a bold new application of technology is in  agriculture, and is in precision agricultural input application. So there are now drones which are  able to navigate autonomously over a field of crops, and can actually recognise the crop that it  is spraying, and spray a precision amount of fertiliser or pesticide on that crop, just enough to  do the job effectively, and not so much that it pollutes the environment, that it damages the  health of farm workers and reduces the soil fertility. So these kinds of applications for precision  agriculture that merge drone technology, autonomous vehicles with artificial intelligence, with  the best science for crop management, and to solve the problem of producing higher quality  crops with less resources and managing the land more effectively, are great new innovations  and we need more of them.  So what are the other industries that these technologies could be applied to to achieve  environmental or social objectives? Using innovation and technology to drive social value is  really a new focus, which we should all be tuned in to.  
Elaine Fernandez:  Billions around the world still lack access to basic needs like clean water, formal shelter and  consistent, affordable energy supply. Providing these necessities won't be possible through  business as usual. To meet these needs, there is an opportunity for companies to rethink their  approach to innovation by leveraging business model redesigns and new technologies to create  social value alongside profit. But this will take bold business leadership that reframes how  investments are made into new opportunities by combining commercial and social value  creation as a new business norm.

People and Purpose: Leadership at Alibaba

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong delved into founder Jack Ma's unconventional approach to leadership in Alibaba, and how it fostered a mission-driven culture across all levels of the organisation.Jack Ma's ability to recognise and nurture talent, predicated on their potential, not just their capabilities and qualifications at the time, was instrumental to some of Alibaba's most innovative and successful hires.Cultivating a mission-driven culture across all rungs of Alibaba’s hierarchical ladder, where everyday tasks were linked to a larger purpose, transformed mundane jobs into meaningful work, enhancing employee motivation and commitment.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  People and Purpose: Leadership at Alibaba  Host:  Every company knows that talent is a critical component of business growth. But finding,  cultivating, and retaining talent is anything but simple. It requires a deep understanding of  people, the ability to see beyond conventional qualifications, and the vision to align individual  capabilities with organisational goals.  And once you’ve found the right talent, for the right job, how do you empower them to bring  your organisation to new heights?  To help address these questions, we’re joined by Brian Wong, former Special Assistant to the  Chairman of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma, and author of the bestselling book “The Tao of Alibaba”.  Brian will share insights into how visionary leader and Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, was able to  identify and nurture talent while fostering an empowering environment across the organisation.  Brian A. Wong:  Jack was an English teacher. He didn't have a technology background. He went to a second or  third-tier college. Most would say he didn't have the credentials to be a tech entrepreneur, but  he proved everyone wrong in what he achieved. And I think it also was a testament that the  kind of success that can be achieved is not only dependent on your credentials, it's also  dependent on your ability to identify problems, your ability to lead people and motivate them.  The charisma, but also, I think, persistence.  I would say that one thing that helped was Jack was very good at identifying talent, but also  good at identifying who was best for certain roles, because you didn't have a homogenous set  of people that all had the same skill set. So I'll give you an example.  When we launched Alipay, which is the payment platform, Jack appointed a founder of that  company and CEO. And most people would have thought that that person should come from a  financial background and work at a bank or a Visa or Mastercard or whatnot.  
So you know who he chose?  He hired a former hotel manager. Now, granted, this individual did have a little bit of work  experience after the hotel management role working at Alibaba in sales. But he said, Jonathan  Lu, you should lead Alipay. And, you know, he said, well, Jack, why should- Why do you want me  to lead Alipay? Because I've never used PayPal. I don't know anything about banks.  He said, no, but you understand customers, you know how to serve their needs. As a hotel  manager, your whole job was about, you know, making sure people are comfortable, and  identifying their needs. And Jonathan was a very successful CEO for Alipay as a result of Jack's  encouraging him, but also having the courage to place him in that role.  Another example is Cainiao, which is a logistics business. The first CEO of Cainio, founding CEO,  was the former secretary and administrator of Alibaba. So she rose from the ranks of just an  office secretary all the way up to the Chief Administrative Officer. And no background like  working at FedEx or UPS or even Amazon. Right?  And most people like, well, what was the rationale behind that? And he, he felt that Judy really  had the ability to understand, you know, systems and how, how to make sure things fit together  kind of within these complex systems, and also understood the ecosystem of Alibaba from her  work background. So these choices, I would say, might not be the most obvious, but at the same  time, identifying the core skills that are required for that role and then finding the right person.  It's very important to craft a mission statement that the founder believes in, that the employees  can buy into, that they get excited and motivated by, but also incorporate an element of  altruism in that statement. So a lot of people often craft a company mission statement that's  very self focused, like to be the world's largest supplier of auto parts or to be number one in  software, rather than just talk about how you want to be so great, talk about how you're going  to help the constituents or the stakeholders that you want to serve and why it should be  meaningful, and then link that to everything that you do and remind your team that there's a  purpose in their daily work.  Even if it's something very mundane, there is a larger sort of impact in what they're doing in the  big picture. So, you know, when I had sent out my sales team to go do work, either in the field  or they'd be dialling to sign up accounts, I always would remind them, you know, you are  actually providing them a window to the world. And if you can get them to sign up, you're going  to open up the possibilities of not just their business, but also all the employees at their  
company for opportunities that they couldn't imagine. And I personally would visit these  businesses and see this.  So I met one guy I remember when I was working in alibaba.com in Vietnam, and he was  making rattan furniture out of bamboo. Before using Alibaba, he was employing nine people  and trying to sell it online or sell it locally, but he wasn't getting much traction. And after using  the Alibaba platform, he started to get sales leads from not just Asia overall, but also in Europe.  And within two years, he had grown his business from nine people to 900.  And he was employing lots of people in his village and selling to places like Europe. And he said  it changed his life. And that doesn't sound like a normal sales job. But then what you realise, a  lot of our sales people, they would be invited to weddings of their customers because their  customers were so grateful that they helped them with their business but also helped them  change their life in terms of the financial position that is very exciting and then the job becomes  a lot more interesting because you're not just selling something, you're actually trying to help  people.  Host:  As Brian shared, Alibaba's success is not just a product of innovative technology and strategic  business models; it is deeply rooted in the company’s unique approach to leadership. Jack Ma’s  ability to identify the right talent for the right roles, often from unconventional backgrounds,  was key to Alibaba’s growth.  Looking past traditional qualifications and focusing on individuals' inherent strengths and  untapped potential, enabled Jack to cultivate a diverse and dynamic team. Equally important  was empowering employees with a sense of purpose. This sense of purpose created a cohesive,  driven workforce dedicated to making a meaningful impact.

Linking Inequality, Environment, and the Economy

### keyTakeaway
In addressing the interlinked crises of inequality, environmental destruction, and other global challenges, Professor David Korten underscored the urgent need to reassess prevailing economic theories. He emphasised that our current trajectory towards excessive consumption and growth is leading to a path of self-extinction. The current economic model, focused on competition and GDP growth, is leading us towards an uninhabitable Earth, necessitating a fundamental shift in our economic theories and practices. The staggering increase in the wealth of the world's billionaires during the COVID-19 pandemic, contrasted with income decline for most people, highlights deepening global inequality. Despite failing to meet basic human needs, our consumption already exceeds what the Earth can sustain by 1.7 times, indicating a severe imbalance and exploitation of natural resources.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Linking Inequality, Environment, and the Economy  Rohan Hazell:  How our economies are designed is fundamental to societal and planetary wellbeing. But what  should be the basis for an economic redesign? And what can we learn from history to avoid past  mistakes and chart a course towards shared prosperity?  To answer these questions, you’ll hear from best-selling author, political activist, and former  Harvard Business School Professor David Korten, who guides us on a journey toward building a  21st century economy; one that ensures all humans can live with dignity whilst protecting the  natural systems that sustain us.  Prof. David Korten:  Well, I think we first have to be absolutely clear on where the problem of inequality fits into our  larger human emergency. We tend to separate these issues of inequality, environmental  destruction, the disruptions of war, issues of race and gender and all of that. And it draws our  attention   away   from   the   deeper   dynamic   that   we   are   literally   on   a   path   to   human  self-extinction.  And it all relates back to the same deeply flawed economic concepts around economic growth.  Which is why I'm so excited about this particular initiative that you folks are sponsoring, this  educational initiative, because it is, you know, it's not just a good idea. It is essential to our  survival as a species.  I, of course, grew up in the west, but I spent 15 years of my life based in Southeast Asia and the  Philippines and Indonesia. And it was actually during those years in that experience that I found  my deepest insights into the dysfunctions of the development theories promoted by the West,  and especially by the United States, but specifically around the issue of inequality.  On January 17, 2022, Oxfam International reported that the wealth of the world's ten richest  billionaires, that's ten billionaires, had doubled since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. And  
meanwhile, the incomes of 99% of the world's people had actually fallen, while corporate  profits were soaring as corporations raised their prices faster than their costs.  In March 2022, Forbes magazine identified a global total of 2668 billionaires with a combined  wealth of 12.7 trillion. That's trillion with a 'T' dollars, up significantly from the 2,096 billionaires  it had identified in 2020, just two years earlier, before COVID became a global pandemic.  Now, the United States is leading the world with 735 billionaires with a collective 4.7 trillion  dollars in financial assets. And China is close second. So here's the joining of East and West,  the United States and China. China is a close second, with 607 billionaires holding 2.3 trillion  dollars in assets. So, together, our two countries account for 56% of the total assets of the  world's billionaires.  Now, we've created a system in which the richer you are, the more likely you are to grow still  richer. And we're seeing that play out in these most dynamic and destructive ways. And the  poorer   you   are,   the   more   likely   you're   going   to   be forced into ever greater debt and  desperation. I assume you're familiar with the global footprint network, which says that even  though we are so far from meeting the needs of most of the world's people, our human  consumption currently exceeds Earth's limits, 1.7 times what Earth can sustain.  And yet, in the midst of this, we're failing to meet the most basic needs of most people. So this  is the most dramatic evidence I can imagine of the fundamental failures of our current  economic theories and practice. And the more we consume, the faster GDP grows and the  faster Earth dies. And one of my most favoured slogans is ‘There are no winners on a dead  Earth.’ You know, we are competing to be the first to destroy Earth's capacity to sustain life.  Rohan Hazell:  Our current economic systems actually help create inequality and environmental degradation.  Without an economic redesign, Professor Korten believes we are on a path to extinction.  In the search for sustainable solutions and more equitable economic approaches, we must draw  on culturally and geographically diverse communities, and recognise that the human emergency  is not comprised of different parts, but is deeply connected.

Challenges to Adopting Policy for Promoting a Circular Economy

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, H.E. Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri described how a lack of coordination and lack of data have been the major impediments to decision-making in developing the UAE’s burgeoning circular economy.A circular economy is a relatively new concept globally, requiring customisation for each country and sector in ways that go beyond existing development norms.A significant challenge in the UAE is the lack of coordination among central and local governments and the private sector. To address this, the UAE established the Circular Economy Council and a policy committee to develop and implement policies effectively.A major hurdle is the lack of reliable data for businesses to adapt their models to circular economy principles. The UAE is addressing this by collaborating with the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center to develop digital mapping and data collection initiatives.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Challenges to Adopting Policy for Promoting  a Circular Economy  Rohan Hazell :  Many governments around the world are now grappling with the transition from a linear to a  circular   economy.   But   such   a   large - scale   transformation   requires   the   support   and  collaboration of many stakeholders, meaning progress is slow in most countries.  One country that has made good progress is the United Arab Emirates. To find out more about  the governance challenges faced in promoting a circular economy, you’ll hear from His  Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy for the UAE.  His Excellency Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri:  There are some challenges in adopting new thinking and the topic of circular economy is  relatively new. It is really recently adopted globally, which makes it a challenge to define it as  well. It needs to be customized and adopted for each country and each   sector. So the purpose  of the UAE circular economy is to highlight the ways the country can transition to the circular  economy, ensuring the use of the resources in the most efficient and resilient fashion.  So when we scope the policy, we scope it in a vast affecting available resources across the  board. We looked at the natural, physical, human, financial resources and acquiring the  cooperation of various   stakeholders,   the central government, the local government, the  private sector, and the civil society.  These are the major stakeholders that we needed to cooperate with. As you know, the UAE  is a federal country, which has a kind of a complex system of federal, local government, and  private sector in each and every Emirates. So this is something where we ne ed to understand  the context, understand how this operates, and we have to understand that the challenges  we take can be measured to deal with them accordingly and in the most effective way  possible, as fast as we can, and to turn these challenges into opp ortunities.  So let me speak about a couple of these challenges. First challenge we faced was the lack of  coordination. When we started circular economy policy, it required concerted efforts from  central and local governments, the private sector, and all concerned part ies to define and  develop circularity in the prioritised sector, in alignment with the UAE Centennial 2071.
  So that's set. And by that what we meant is how do we have a step to create the synergies,  reevaluate and upgrade our current approaches and economy, business and financial practice  towards the use of natural resources.  For this reason, we decided to start the Circular Economy Council, as I mentioned, chaired by  Her Excellence Mariam Almheiri, the Minister of Climate Change and the Environment and  where I serve as a vice chair.  From that as well, we issued the Circular Economy Policy Committee that I head and from  there we managed to implement and develop a roadmap for the implementation of about 22  policy proposals. Now the policy proposal will go through the minister's level, s o we can issue  them.  Some have to go on a   local level issue   and some and then need actually a cabinet decree. So  we managed as well to understand where these 22 policies, who can issue what, which level  can it really go? And the complexity of it as   well and   issuing and taking it forward.  The second more important challenge that we are facing is the lack of data. The UAE is  committed to and working towards development of innovative and creative tools to practice  leading more effective circularity and transformative business goals.  When we sat with the private sector, the major challenges they say if we knew the data that  we have on the local governments, the local entities in areas where we can actually look at it  -   then we can understand how business models can be evaluated and how   reliable this data  is. And part of this effort is to provide clear direction to allow monitoring of implementation.  So we understood this and now we're experiencing with our part possible avenue to address  this particular issue. And we have developed with the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics  Centre , a digital map, and a digital collection initiative with local governments and the private  sector.  All the smaller challenges might appear as we   continue,   and this is something we are very  well known to be very agile to look at things   and   find solutions. The good thing is we have the  private sector with us. They will look at challenges and they will give us solutions to help us  as well, to help them to grow the UAE especially in the circularity aspect.  Rohan Hazell:  The challenges facing policy implementation are many, and His Excellency has highlighted two  which are critical: the need for reliable contextual   information and   establishing appropriate  systems of coordination.
  Addressing these two challenges early on in the process leads to more effective collaboration,  but only if vital inputs from key stakeholders are gathered and factored into decision - making.

Externalities of Products

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT Managing Director Eric Stryson highlighted the many externalities generated by the products we consume to sustain daily life, from rising rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) to rampant pollution.The excessive consumption of sugar is comparable to the tobacco epidemic, leading to severe health consequences such as obesity and diabetes, with an estimated economic burden of $2.5 trillion by 2030.Plastic waste presents a major environmental threat, with alarming projections suggesting that by 2050, there may be more plastic waste in the ocean than fish.While plastic is indispensable in modern life, the current approach to managing plastic waste is unsustainable, necessitating a fundamental shift in production and consumption practices towards a circular economy model.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Externalities of Products  Elaine Fernandez:  Every product we make and consume carries unintended consequences beyond the immediate  transaction.  From   dietary   staples   to   every   manner   of   tool and appliance, any item we purchase is  underpinned by a whole network of supply chains, with the possibility of externalities occurring  at every step.  To illustrate this, Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global Institute For Tomorrow, will take  us through some of the externalities pervading the food industry and also the impact the use of  plastic has had on public health and the environment.  Eric Stryson:  Another classic externality which I'd like to talk about is in the food system and the food that we  eat. We can say that given the obesity epidemic in modern societies, that sugar is the new  tobacco. The damage that excess sugar has had on human health, the burden that it is placed  on the healthcare system and the overall reduction in quality of life for millions of people who  are obese or overweight is dramatic.  It is estimated that around the world, 1.9 billion people are obese or overweight. Two-thirds of  these are in developing countries, and this is due in large part to the under-pricing of excessive  sugar and excessive processing of our food that we eat, which results in huge profits for the  food companies that produce the food, but don't pay the true price for what they're producing.  The global economic burden of diabetes is estimated to rise to about $2.5 trillion by 2030. And  diabetes is an epidemic which is caused predominantly by excessive packaged, processed, and  food with excessive sugar.  The problem of obesity and overweight populations is not limited to developed countries like  the US, like the UK, Australia and elsewhere. Developing countries are actually bearing a  significant burden given the growth of consumption in processed food and food with excessive  
sugar. In China, the percentage of children who are overweight has grown from less than 5% to  more than 20% in just 35 years.  So, there is a direct correlation between economic growth and the growth of affluence and a  growing   middle   class   with   the   consumption   of   unhealthy food, food that is excessively  processed, that has excessive amounts of sugar, which leads to populations being overweight  and suffering ill health side effects.  At least 54 countries around the world have introduced a sugar tax to reduce consumption. So,  that is in a way repricing sugar to internalise the externalised costs. And only when we price  sugar appropriately in order to moderate its consumption will we see the health impacts of  excessive sugar consumption reducing.  So, this is not to put entirely the blame on sugar or to demonise sugar unnecessarily. This is  really to suggest that the under-pricing of sugar has led to the overconsumption and therefore  the negative health impacts that people suffer from eating too much sugar. So big food  companies are often fighting these measures like putting a sugar tax on certain foods.  Of course, many of them are now shifting to healthier alternatives. They are creating products  with less sugar or in smaller portions, and that is an attempt to address the public backlash and  the regulatory backlash, which has come from the under-pricing of junk food.  So unhealthy food is still a growth industry around the world. Why?  One of the most visible and obvious and troubling externalities is that of plastic waste. And I  think plastic waste is now perhaps only second to climate change in the public consciousness  around the even existential threat that it poses to ecosystems, to human health and to the  sustainability of society as we know it.  Plastic waste is a good illustration of an externality because neither the producers of the plastic  nor the consumers of the plastic pay the true price of the proliferation of the plastic waste. In  general, it is the role of the government to provide waste collection services and ideally to  foster the circular economy for plastic waste. But most governments have failed in this  responsibility.  Every year we produce somewhere in the order of 380 million tons of plastic. In all of human  history, we can see some 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste that has been produced since plastic  was invented.  It's a very durable, practical, and useful application of technology. Modern life would not be  what it is without plastic. And plastic has a usefulness in so many aspects of our lives that we  cannot expect plastic to go away anytime soon. But we must manage it better. We must price in  
the externalised costs of plastic waste and the damage that it does to our environment and to  our health.  Indeed, while almost all plastic can be recycled, less than 10% of all plastic has ever been  recycled. Therefore, the true costs of plastic waste have been externalised to society and to the  environment to such a degree that by 2050, scientists believe that there may be more plastic  waste in the ocean than fish by weight. This is a very scary proposition and things are starting to  change. But the question is, will they change fast enough?  So, is a world without plastic unimaginable? Perhaps now. But is a world without plastic waste  unimaginable? I would argue not. But we need to fundamentally rethink and reorganise our  economy, our production, our consumption, and the supply chains for plastic waste and  transform that into plastic feedstock, which can be fed back into new material production.  Elaine Fernandez:  Even when industry creates products to address societal needs, externalities are still an  unavoidable side effect.  Sugar, for example, has always been an integral component of the human diet, but the rise of  large-scale industrial production has led to an influx of underpriced sugar, thus enabling  widespread overconsumption.  Beyond the strain it places on human health and healthcare systems in general, we know that  sugar overconsumption is particularly detrimental to lower-income groups and developing  nations due to their limited access to healthier alternatives.  Plastic, on the other hand, has in many ways been the material that’s enabled our modern way  of life.  However,   its   underpriced value, widespread use and improper disposal have resulted in  devastating environmental pollution.  While governments and businesses are recognising the impact of plastic pollution, more critical  questions about what drives the use of plastic - such as the way we consume - are needed to  tackle the root causes of these externalities in our policies and business models.

Shortcomings of States

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson highlighted the significant challenge of balancing private interests, public good, and effective governance in modern states.Governments often face criticism for being influenced by private interests and lobbyists, which can lead to policies that prioritise corporate benefits over public welfare.Corruption and nepotism within governments significantly hinder national development by diverting crucial funds from essential public services like education and healthcare.Human rights abuses and the overextension of government power into societal sectors can damage trust between the State and its citizens.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Shortcomings of States  Elaine Fernandez:  Governments can bring immense benefits to their citizens. But they are far from   perfect and   can  be impacted by the influence of vested interests, corruption, and even an overreliance on the  private sector.  To further explore the dynamic interplay between governments, private interests, and civil  society, you’ll hear from Eric Stryson, Managing Director at the Global Institute For Tomorrow.  Eric Stryson:  Governments can be usurped by vested   interests,   and this happens all over the world, not just in  the overt cronyism and corruption, but indeed it happens in very advanced economies where  lobbyists and business interests influence government policy in the favour of private sector and  large corporations,   and often marginalised certain sections of society.  So businesses certainly can and do contribute to the development and the betterment of a nation  when they work with the state constructively. But government policy   making,   and government  regulation cannot be subservient to private interests.  In the United States, as one example, by some estimates there are 100,000 lobbyists whose role  is to work to influence the government, often in favour of the private sector and large  corporations. Even if that number is at the lower estimate of 15 to 20,00 0. It presents a major  influence and a major challenge to effective policymaking that takes the interests of the majority  into account.  Corruption and nepotism can be debilitating to the way a country is run and to its developmental  trajectory. Malaysia, as just one example, saw one of the largest financial scandals in history take  place at the hands of its former prime minister, which cos t the country in the order of $3.5 billion.  That is a transformative amount of money which can be channelled into national services,  education, healthcare and any number of public services to help promote the development of
  the country. Therefore, corruption and nepotism are one of the key challenges and the key  shortcomings to an effective modern state.  Government should not rely too heavily on business, which can prioritise profit over social needs.  In fact, that is what they are meant to do in the interests of private company owners and  shareholders. For example, if a private company were running a hosp ital, they may be  incentivised to cut corners on patient care in order to save costs and increase profits. They  certainly would not stockpile additional supplies unless they were given support by the  government to do so. And we saw this during the pandemic , where privatised healthcare  institutions were unprepared for the urgent need for PPE once the pandemic struck.  Equally, the private profit motive within companies means that they may not invest in the long -  term solutions to address social needs if it does not provide immediate return on investment. So  therefore, if a government is seeking to privatise certain servi ces or rely on the private sector to  address certain social needs. They need to understand and provide incentives and even support  to enable the private sector to do so. So business can certainly contribute to the progress and to  the development and better ment of a nation.  They can and do work with the state. But the government needs to be aware that too much  influence can have a detrimental effect on policymaking and on meeting the needs of the  majority. There are also, of course, human rights abuses. The overextension of g overnment  power into various sectors of the economy and into society can lead to human rights abuses.  Getting human rights management correct, getting it right, is really critical for building trust  between the state and civil society and the people that it serves. I think one of the failures of  modern governments is not building a strong and effective civil society. And the civil society are  all of those non - governmental, non - business organisations   which essentially operate at the  community level or throughout society, where there are gaps in the provision of public services  or people's needs are not being met.  There are areas where governments find it difficult to reach and where businesses simply will not  go because it's not profitable. These are areas where the civil sector, the NGO's need to step in  and provide support, provide resources to really help meet t he needs in society. For example,  providing food and shelter to the needy, to the homeless, to those who have been affected by  natural disasters.
  Civil society provides frontline insights and responsiveness based on community needs and really  allows the sentiment of the people to be communicated to the government in order to change  and to adjust to meet people's needs.  Elaine Fernandez:  States are far from perfect. Corruption and nepotism are present in almost all governments.  Equally, the State can be easily influenced by the private sector, leading to policies that favour  business over society. Governments may also overlook the importan ce of building a strong civil  society.  Non - profit civil society organisations, including charities, industry associations and advocacy  groups help to provide services that the public and private sectors do not, for example feeding  homeless communities or regulating certain professions.  They also provide valuable feedback to governments. This can involve protests, but it also  includes think tanks or even religious groups that work with the public sector. What this tells us  is that governments have a responsibility to listen to their citiz ens and course correct   -   or they  will be failing to meet the obligations they owe to their countries.

The Key Features of Globalisation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair highlighted globalisation’s defining features, as he sees them.Modern-day globalisation’s ten key features are: unparalleled speed of trade; opportunities for travel; evolution of technology; instant gratification; interconnected finance; urbanisation; mass migration; labour displacement; weakened social nets; and cultural erosion.Each of these features comes with a host of both positive and negative impacts on societies worldwide.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Key Features of Globalisation  Rohan Hazell:  The term globalisation was coined in 1983. Since then, it’s been discussed continually. But to  understand how it impacts you, your organisation, and your country, it’s important to know  what its key features are.  Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, will run you through the most important aspects of  globalisation as he sees them, ranging from an increasing speed of trade to widespread shifts in  identity.  Chandran Nair:  So, let's spend a few minutes now talking about the key features of modern-day globalisation.  First, I think we can all agree that a feature of today's globalisation is the unparalleled speed of  trade. The pandemic actually put that in focus. As soon as trade routes began to shut down,  borders began to shut down. Many of us realised how used we had got to trade being so free,  so open, and so fast. So that's one feature – unparalleled speed or trade. You could buy  something in China and have it delivered in India or in the UK or in Malaysia within the space of  three or four days.  The other was the death of distance. Essentially the ability of many of us to travel and to go to  places and be in a remote place within less than 12 hours even. Again, the pandemic highlighted  how we all got used to the death of distance. But now we understand that we had taken that all  for granted too. So, the death of distance was another feature of globalisation.  Another feature of today's globalisation is the view that technology is a panacea. What we  mean by that, that technology is a cure for all the ills of the world. It's becoming very clear and  increasingly becoming clearer that technology is not the panacea. If you do not have structures  within which you're dealing with societal issues, and you're dealing with essentially the  overreach of technology too.  Then there is that issue that many of us are trapped and addicted to, the entitlement to instant  gratification. Anything and everything we want should be instant. We don't have to wait around  
for anything, that the information should come quickly, that if we want food ordered, it should  arrive within a short space of time. And if we trade with a different country, those things too  need to be faster than ever before.  Then there is that instant information, the ability through digital technology now to have  information at our fingertips. A lot of that information is probably useless, but still instant  information. Information that now is so readily available they're also beginning to disrupt  societies in ways that very few anticipated.  Then we have the globalisation of finance, the way the financial systems of the world are  designed today that allow for money to be transferred, both small and large amounts, in ways  that no one could have imagined. That you could transfer money from the UK to Africa or from  the US to India and all have it done within the space of a couple of minutes, and sometimes in  some instances even less than that. But the globalisation of finance also came in major risk as  we have seen with the issue of contagion and the effect that financial overexposure in one part  of the world can affect hundreds of millions of people around different parts of the world, as we  saw about 15 years ago, with the financial crisis emanating out of the USA.  Another feature of today's globalisation is the economic idea that urbanisation is the pathway  towards essentially economic success, and that countries needed to urbanise to essentially  achieve their productivity gains that that theory essentially advocates. So, urbanisation is now a  feature of today's globalisation and urban centres around the world are connected in ways that  would now we could never have imagined before.  A key feature of today's globalisation is the mass migration of people, some forced on by  circumstances, geopolitical wars, et cetera, but also by virtue of the fact that countries are more  tolerant, they open their borders and essentially we need the migration of people to fill labour  gaps in different parts of the world. As I speak today, there is a lot of discussion about the  dangers of the migration of skilled medical workers from developing countries to the developed  countries where there is a huge demand now for trained nurses, doctors, et cetera. And so, this  mass migration is not always a net benefit as well. What do you do to control those things?  The other part of today's globalisation, which is related to technology, is the displacement of  labour by technology. The advocates of technology argue that this is not something to be  worried about and that labs will always find different avenues to essentially be employed. This is  not proving to be the case, even in the United States, but that debate continues to move along  the same trajectory - that technology will not displace labour, but labour will find other  channels for gainful employment.  The last two I like to mention are more to do with our societies and our cultures. The first is the  erosion of social nets and the loss of innocence. Because we are so globalised, and because we  are so entwined, both through technology and through ideas, there's an erosion of social nets in  many societies and the loss of innocence as well.  
And this is, in my view, having catastrophic impacts in many societies, and governments and  societies around the world are beginning to have to confront them, though I'm not sure many  have dealt with this in the ways that they need to.  And finally, there's the issue of cultural erosion, which points back to the case made by Amartya  Sen that much globalisation is Westernisation and with Westernisation comes the erosion of  cultures in other parts of the world.  As that process essentially became much faster, speeded up all across the world, many people  in different parts of the world began to worry about their identity as they embraced Western  ideas, et cetera. And those things in turn created tensions within their society. So, there's the  whole question today of the re-examination of identity going on in different parts of the world,  sometimes even resulting in conflicts.  Rohan Hazell:  To recap, there are ten key features of modern day globalisation. These are:  ●   Unparalleled speed of trade  ●   Opportunities for travel  ●   Evolution of technology  ●   Instant gratification  ●   Interconnected finance  ●   Urbanisation  ●   Mass migration  ●   Labour displacement  ●   Weakened social nets  ●   And cultural erosion  These features have both positive and negative impacts. As we progress further into the 21st  century, the challenge will be to maximise the benefits, while reducing the drawback and  equitably as possible.

Understanding Technology:  How the Tools We Build Shape Us

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Eric Stryson unpacked the essence of technology and its profound yet double-edged role in human progress throughout history.From the Stone Age to the present, technology has been a cornerstone of societal and human advancement, serving as a problem-solving tool that shapes our world.The application of technology comes with inherent trade-offs, emphasising the importance of understanding and managing them to harness technology's benefits responsibly.Technology can have positive or negative impacts, and these hinge on the intent and actions of its wielders. For example, the technology used for commercial fishing can be used to conserve fish stocks.The importance of foundational technologies such as water sanitation, electrification, and sewage treatment are often overlooked, despite being crucial for public health and the wellbeing of billions worldwide.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Understanding Technology: How the Tools We Build Shape Us  Tsubasa Nair:  For most of us, the word technology brings to mind the latest gadgets and apps, but these are  only the latest chapters in a much longer story. From the first stone tools to the AI revolution  and everything in between, technology has been humanity's constant companion, shaping our  societies and way of life.  But what exactly is "technology"? What is its purpose?  To unpack these questions, we're joined by Eric Stryson, Managing Director of the Global  Institute For Tomorrow. Eric will help us better understand the essence of technology and its  profound impact on humanity.  Eric Stryson:  Technology gets a lot of airtime in the world today, but fundamentally we should understand  that technology is a problem solving tool. we think back to, uh, terms like the Stone Age, that's  essentially a technology driven tool. The first time people shaped tools with stone or with  metal,   they   were   actually   using   technology   to   shape   their   world.   So   it's   fundamental.  Technology has shaped human society for better and for worse. I think without technology, we  can say that there is no human progress, but we should understand that technology comes with  trade-offs and how we manage those trade-offs.  Technology is something that we talk about with regards to digital, with regards now to AI, but  there's a lot of technologies that we take for granted, which form the foundations of modern  society, and we need to really understand the trade-offs of those technologies.  What problem are we trying to solve with technology?  It's essentially the application of scientific understanding to industry, typically, and it is meant to  solve a problem. So it really is dependent on how we use that problem solving tool and to ask  ourselves, what is the problem that we're trying to solve?  
I think a great illustration of this is if we look at, for example, commercial fishing. So when it  comes to something like the commercial fishing industry, it provides a really interesting example  because the same technologies that we can use to vastly expand the productive capacity of  fishing fleets. The sensor technology, the satellite positioning system, the analytics, including AI;  All of which can zero in, identify, and allow commercial fishing fleets to scoop up every last fish  in a particular section of the ocean.  Those same technologies can alternatively be used as a tool for conservation and for ensuring  that fishing stocks rebound and are rejuvenated. And how is that? Well, there are great  examples now of how the automatic identification system and the responders, which are  compulsory on fishing fleets can be used and have been used to essentially track and monitor.  And enforce regulations in particular, uh, fishing regions that are endangered and that therefore  allow the fish stocks to replenish. So the same technologies can be used for conservation as for  extraction. It just depends on how we use them.  Transformative technology: Simpler than we think  Today we are infatuated with digital technology. In fact, when we do courses and we ask people,  “What is the most transformative technology in history?” Inevitably, most of the groups will talk  about the Internet, about mobile computing, digital technology, blockchain, Web 3.0, et cetera.  And we understand that these are very transformative technologies. But we should also  remember that the most transformative technologies are not digital. They are things like  electrification, things like water and sanitation and sewerage, modern building materials, like  ammonia fertiliser that has allowed the human population to grow more food than ever before  and to essentially fuel the human population.  We often overlook the basics of, for example, sewage treatment and its relation to public  health. I think globally, there are somewhere in the order of 1.5 billion people who currently do  not have access to basic sewage systems and who therefore live in regions that have human  waste proliferating in the environment.  Something like three and a half or so million people die every year from waterborne diseases,  which are completely preventable with proper sanitation and wastewater treatment. So the  connection between a foundational technology like proper wastewater treatment and public  health is totally underestimated when we talk about technology. And at present, again, there  are somewhere in the order of half a billion people globally who lack access to clean, safe  
drinking water. So that's a foundational technology, which we need to figure out how to scale up  and how to drive investment into those wastewater treatment systems.  The over-expectations of digital technology  I think there is an assumption that digital technology by itself, and greater connectivity, personal  mobile computing, etc., will essentially solve all our problems and even end poverty.  I think if you go back 15 to 20 years, when the birth of social media and mobile computing was a  hot topic, there was an implicit assumption that just by connecting people to the mobile  internet, it would improve their lives. It would allow them to reduce poverty and raise  themselves up to a better quality of life. That didn't really happen to the degree that we  expected.  And I think there is a similar expectation now with the most advanced digital technologies,  including AI. I think we need to remember that technology is a problem solving tool. And it's a  tool, which means it's a means to an end. We should not consider technology as an end unto  itself. And we should be very careful not to assume that the purpose of technology is simply as a  pathway to increased riches for the owners of that technology. We really need to understand  and, and refocus our attention on what problem we're trying to solve with the technology.  Tsubasa Nair:  All technology is ultimately a tool built to solve a problem. But it can be easy to forget this, as  we often believe that technological progress is a goal unto itself.  This is partly why foundational technologies, like sewage systems and affordable housing, don’t  receive the same attention or investment.  When considering the adoption of new technologies in our organisations, we should ask  ourselves: what problem is it solving? With the proliferation of so much new technologies,  many of which can have large, unintended consequences, this question is becoming more  important than ever.

The Role of Government in the Economy 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, John Perkins explored The New Deal under US President Roosevelt. He challenged certain aspects of neoliberalism and proposed initial steps to rectify externalised costs, subsidies, and pollution. In the US, the New Deal proved successful in providing jobs, emphasising the government's role in societal wellbeing. This, John Perkins argues, differs from the modern approach with neoliberal tendencies. The government has a pivotal role in implementing policies for sustainable practices, including mandating transparent accounting to help incorporate external costs. John Perkins encourages a shift in individual perceptions of success, moving beyond material wealth and status to instead align personal success with societal and environmental wellbeing.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Role of Government in the Economy  Rohan Hazell:  Most people usually think of the economy in extractive terms: we extract raw materials, convert  them into products and the more people buy, the stronger, better and healthier the economy is.  Clearly this needs to be reimagined, but how can governments take steps to create a restorative  economy that cleans our air and water, regenerates our land, and maximises long - term societal  and planetary wellbeing?  We speak with John Perkins, author of the best - selling Confessions of an Economic Hitman, to  find out more.  John Perkins:  The New Deal under Roosevelt in the United States was very successful at doing that sort of thing.  At that time, it wasn't about the environment. It was about providing jobs for people. But it's  where the government can step in to do this, which is, which   is the opposite of what  Neoliberalism teaches, which was what was promoted by Milton Friedman and others. But I think  we can step away from that.  And there's some very initial simple steps. One of them is to stop externalising costs. So, when  you figure out the profit statement of a corporation, you don't calculate in there the damage that  it's done in making its products either to people's lives by   making people sick and not taking care  of them, or when they get sick, they get fired. Or by destroying the environment, what's it going  to cost to clean it up? Those costs aren't included for the most part.  And the subsidies that we do, like you know, different countries have different aspects of that.  And I can speak for the United States where we subsidise the big oil companies. Can you imagine?  I mean, these kinds of companies are so profitable, and yet th ey're subsidised by the US taxpayer,  big agriculture firms. So ending those kinds of policies is a huge step forward and insisting that,  that the accounting, the accountants take into account what we call external costs, that the, you  know, the ones that a re damaging, that don't get taken into account.  So those are several big steps that can be taken immediately. The government really doesn't have  to do anything except to change the laws or to change the accounting system, to change the
  taxing system, to change the subsidy system. A few policies like that would go a very, very long  way.  And of course the other side of it is charge for pollution. So, this idea of carbon offsets that people  have to pay for carbon offsets. We've got the ideas in place. We know what it takes. We know  what we can do. There's just no question about it. But it d oes take putting the mechanisms in  place and it does take having the willpower to really make it.  If we take the United States, if we stop subsidising fossil fuels. If we stop subsidising big oil and  big pharma and big agribusiness   and put that money to paying people, to go out and pick up  plastic and work in places where it can be recycled.  The oil companies don't need to be subsidised and there's a huge amount of money that goes  into that, and tax. Make the rich pay as many taxes as I have to pay, which they don't right now.  And, you know, some of the most profitable global corporations last   year paid absolutely no taxes  and got subsidies from the US government and tax breaks.  It's outrageous. And that money could all be spent toward providing jobs for people. And I think  many other countries can do similar types of things. I also think it's a question of attitude and  priorities. And I have a new book coming out in February, whi ch is called The Confessions of an  Economic Hitman   -   third edition, China's Economic Hitman Strategy and How to Stop the Global  Takeover.  And I go into a lot. I taught in China at an MBA program there a few years back. And I was  impressed by how the Chinese students said, we've lived with terrible pollution. We've grown up  with it. We don't want that anymore. You in the United States, your y oung people don't really  understand what it's like to live on pollution. Oh, Los Angeles may have had some, right now  there's some smoke outside my window from some of the fires that are burning. We're beginning  to experience it, but other places that real ly have experienced it like China, these young people  are saying, we don't want that. We're going to turn this thing around. Will they do it? I don't  know.  But what I do know is recently a study came up that indicated that in the last seven years, China  has reduced pollution by more than the United States has for 30 years. So that's pretty big. And  while China's still the number one polluter in the world, it' s also got a huge population.  China's per capita creation   of carbon dioxide is about 7 tons per person. The US is 14. Twice  China's. So, we've got a long way to go. And I think that in this book of mine, it talks about the  good things that both the United States and China have done an d the bad things we've both  done.  But the final conclusion is we can disagree on an awful lot, we can disagree. We can criticise their  policies in Hong Kong. They can criticise our policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we can criticise
  their treatment of the Uyghurs. They can criticise our treatment of immigrants and so on and so  forth.  But let's all, let's both countries agree that we've got to stop this insanity of competing for a death  economy, looking at short - term economic growth and come together to lead world into  understanding that we must redefine what it means to be a successful   country and what it means  to be a successful corporation, what it means to be successful as individuals.  Perhaps the most important aspect is a change of our perception of what it means to be  successful human beings on this planet.  And perception rules control reality. There's no Philippines, there's no United States, there's no  China, there's no country, there's no religion, there's no culture, there's no corporations until  somebody perceives them. And once enough people accept a pe rception or codify into law, it  changes reality.  So, we must move away from the perception that our heroes are the people that ravaged the  earth. Bill Gates is not a hero. Elon Musk is not a hero. These are people that are not devoted to  creating a long - term future for all of us. Musk is saying he is dev oting himself to the future. We  can go to Mars, but who's going to go to Mars?  Let's take care of our own planet first. And, you know, he's setting himself up so that if we destroy  this planet, he and his children and grandchildren can take a rocket ship to Mars. But put that  money toward paying people to do something that'll make a   long - term improvement on this  planet.  So, a lot of it is our own perception and the media perception of what it means to be a hero, what  it means to be a leader, what it means to be successful, and what does it mean for me to be  successful.  So, I think we have to redefine what it means to be successful as human beings and what it means  to be happy. That's a major step. And then how do we put that into policies? How do we set up  a system where people can make a really good living as musicians,   as artists, as poets, as writers,  as carpenters using sustainable materials. It's not difficult to figure that out. All we've got to do  is basically reset our goals, reset our definition of success.  Rohan Hazell:  As John Perkins has shared, the government plays a vital role in redefining success and replacing  the accumulation of wealth and winner - takes - all mentality with collaborative approaches toward  equitable growth.
  This is crucial if governments are to provide lower - income citizens with access to the basic rights  to life.

Policy Decision-Making and Implementation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Christine Loh explored the unique role and responsibilities of government in acting for the collective public interest and shared her decision-making process called PISCES.The government possesses unique tools like law-making and taxation to create a better society, emphasising the need for clarity in using these tools for public interests.PISCES: Prioritising issues, dealing with vested Interests, finding Solutions, considering Costs, assessing Equity, and Socialising ideas. This framework helps governments and businesses alike with complex decision-making.Companies operate within the legal framework set by the government but should strive to exceed mere legal compliance. Responsible businesses also consider societal expectations, such as providing fair wages and working conditions.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Policy Decision - Making and Implementation  Rohan Hazell :  Decision - making at the governmental level has the potential to impact entire industries or  segments of society.  Professor Christine Loh, Chief Development Strategist at Hong Kong University of Science and  Technology’s Institute for the Environment, walks us through how policymakers make  decisions, and the motivations behind their actions.  She also introduces us to her own decision - making framework, developed during her time as  a legislator in Hong Kong.  Professor Christine Loh:  Government is a very special thing. Government has been empowered under whatever  system that people have to act for the collective. Government is there to act for all of us, and  therefore we expect the government to act in something we call the public inte rest. And the  public interest is the interest of the whole, not of any specific segment of the community.  Now, obviously, if you are a company, a company does not have all the tools and the powers  of government, and governments are there to provide regulation and codes and guidelines  for society at large, and that's why I think government is very special becau se they have to  understand what is the widest public interest.  They have a certain set of tools that no one else in society has, so they're able to tax people,  they're able to pass laws that people have to obey. They can give subsidies and incentives and  penalties. So, therefore, all these tools that governments have,   they're there to create a  better society, which is why the government has to be clear about how they use these tools  for the public interest.  So, companies fall within the legal environment that these tools guide. So, the license to  operate for a company is to understand what these rules are, and actually to perhaps do a  little bit better, because for governments to pass laws and to regulate oft en it takes some  time.
  So, a responsible business will hopefully think about after complying with the law, what you  do and how you do it, does it comply with the social, the societal expectation of what a good  company would do? So, for example you are paying the minimum wage, bu t could you do  better under certain circumstances? What kind of society are you in? What would provide a  certain living standard for that society? And are you rewarding people at a level that your  business can afford and that it's better for society?  So, I think the idea of social license to operate actually is one bar up from mere legal  compliance and generally it's an indication that a company that has the social license to  operate from people. People generally feel quite good about that company beca use they  regard that as a good and responsible company in their society.  So there could be, let's say, a new idea in society, for example, to protect the environment,  not to people pollute as much as they used to protect public health, for example, to protect  biodiversity. Companies will have to obey these when laws are passed,   but there is a period  of time before new laws are in place.  So, this is why responsible companies would actually go above the legal compliance, but the  role of government to guard the public interest is what we want our governments to do, and  only they have the tools to reflect it and to protect society.  I can use an acronym that I used to kind of remind people. It's the astrological chart of PISCES.  So, ‘P’ stands for priority. In any society we have to prioritise at any one time. And you know,  even for governments, governments are very large administrative bodies. You can only do so  much at any one time. So every government must prioritise. So, we ar e talking about the  environment, whether the environment is of a sufficiently high priority at any one time.  Then the second issue is ‘I’, interest. Politics very often is about how to deal with vested  interest. People haven't had to do something for a long time, or they've been doing certain  things for a long time. And the new idea is you mustn't do it anymore o r you have to change  your behaviour. So, dealing with vested interests is never easy in any society.  Then the first ‘S’ is solution. So, you understand what your problem is, you've prioritised it,  and you're prepared to deal with a vested interest, but do you know what to do? So, it's very  important to actually also think through what your solutions are a nd whether your solutions  are implementable.  Then the first ‘C’ is cost. There's always a cost to everything. Can you afford that cost? Now,  that cost, you can look at it from both ways. You know, can you do it? What does it need for  it to be done? And if you didn't do it, what cost would there be to   society?
  So, that comes to the next alphabet ‘E’, which is equity, because we can look at cost from the  minus, you know, because it costs you money. But the second one is really, well, what are the  benefits? And do we truly understand the benefits? Because often, t he benefits deal with  social equity that you are creating a better society.  And the last ‘S’ is socialisation. What does socialisation mean? It means that, well, once you  have an idea that you want to change something, even before you go and change the laws  you have to socialise the idea.  If the government has a new idea, you have to deal with vested interests. You have to make  sure you have the support of society and how do you do that? You have to socialise it within  society, so you have public support.  You also have to socialise it within the bureaucracy because you need different parts of the  bureaucracy to be able to implement and to enforce any new laws. So just remember PISCES,  if you have to think through the question of well, why sometimes we are s low in doing new  things.  Changing policies, first of all, within government requires you to make sure that the  government bureaucracy itself agrees to the change, and you have to make sure who will be  responsible for making the policy and implementing the change.  So, there's always an internal discussion about who has to do what. And sometimes there are  arguments within the government to say, well, you know, is it my, is it my bit of the  government, or your bit of the government? So, sometimes there's a bit of push ing to say,  well this new policy, who should be responsible for it? So, this is the kind of internal bargaining  that can take place.  Secondly, is it incremental? Or is it actually quite a major departure from the status quo?  Obviously if it is something incremental, it's easier to do, it's easier to argue, maybe you just  need to, you know, change a standard, right, to improve and tighte n a standard and you just  need to change the law a little bit.  But if you actually want to go in a different direction, you do have to think about it. So, for  example, in waste management, if you previously did not charge people for waste, or if you  didn't ask them that they have to separate the waste, then when you a re asking them to  actually do quite a lot of new things, that is a change in direction and that requires actually  very extensive and skillful thinking through about how you're going to do it right, the solutions  are how you're going to do it, and is it goi ng to work? So, there's a lot of testing.  So, this sometimes also delays the implementation, the rolling out of certain government  policies. That's why sometimes even when people are prioritising certain policies like waste
  management, it takes actually some years to go from step one to step two, and then it might  take another few years to go from step two to step three.  Now, when you also have to build infrastructure, and sometimes this infrastructure, for  example, in climate adaptation, you know, in waste time to make waste plants, these are all  quite expensive. And then you have to look at a particular jurisdiction. How   are they going to  raise the money to do that? And can they invest in enough infrastructure to actually be able  to implement a new directional change in policies?  Rohan Hazell:  Professor Loh has highlighted that policymakers must consider multiple trade - offs when  making decisions.  They must factor in outcomes for different stakeholders and rally support for their policy  choices before they can be properly implemented.  Whether you work in the public or private sector, it is important, therefore, to understand  what drives decision - makers and how these factors can impact the possibilities for change.

The TaoBao Effect: Turning Observation into Innovation and Mobilisation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong discussed how Alibaba's practice of keenly observing - and acting on - market dynamics and consumer behaviour led to groundbreaking innovations like Taobao, which revolutionised e-commerce throughout China.Observation is the critical first step in the innovation process. By paying close attention to consumer behaviour and local market dynamics, Alibaba was able to tailor its solutions to meet the unique needs of its audience.Alibaba's success with Taobao, its largest online marketplace, stemmed from an understanding of local market preferences. Tailoring solutions that resonated with Chinese consumers, enabled Alibaba to offer a more authentic and engaging user experience, and outpace global competitors like eBay.By providing rural entrepreneurs with the tools and infrastructure - TaoBao - required to transition into the formal economy, Alibaba created a ripple effect of economic development in underserved areas. 

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The TaoBao Effect: Turning Observation into Innovation and  Mobilisation  Host:  Opportunities for innovation are abundant but seizing them depends entirely on our ability to  perceive them in the first place. Thus, observation is the critical first step in the innovation  process, allowing us to identify gaps, understand needs, and envision new possibilities.  At Alibaba, one of the world's largest e-commerce giants, keen observation and a deep  understanding of the local market dynamics paved the way for one of its many transformative  innovations, including the formation of Taobao, China's largest online marketplace.  Let’s hear more about these innovations from one of Alibaba’s top former executives, Brian  Wong.Brian previously served as Special Assistant to the Chairman of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma,  and is the author of the bestselling book “The Tao of Alibaba”.  Brian A. Wong:  So one example I'd like to share is around a company called Taobao, which is the retail  marketplace that we created in 2003. Not unlike eBay, and actually, eBay at the time was  entering China with very aggressive, very successful entry in terms of capturing the market that  existed at the time. It was still very early, but what eBay did was to take their model from the  US, Silicon Valley specifically, and apply it to the China market.  You know, very clean, simple UI that was really geared towards just promoting the transactions  that required or that people were trying to do online. But I think Jack and the team observed  this. They studied it, and they went about it very differently.  If you looked at the Taobao website versus eBay, eBay was very clean and slick and simple, and  Taobao was just a mess. It just had, you know, all these pictures all over the place. It had things  jumping around, and it just looked crowded, and it looked messy. And a lot of people thought  that was a recipe for failure. But what Jack and the team said is that the Chinese consumer, if  
you go to a marketplace, there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of lights, there's a lot of just stuff  going on. But people want liveliness, they want energy. They feel like if you go to a marketplace,  you should have that kind of chaos, because that is what represents vibrancy. And so, they went  through that approach, and a lot of people say that the success of Taobao in some ways was  because it was built for the local market.  Another example from that era was eBay did not allow buyers and sellers to communicate  directly. They basically were in the middle of that transaction because there was a commission  that the business model was to generate revenue through these transactions. But what Taobao  actually allowed was for a live chat tap in between buyer and seller.  And why is that?  If you go to a Chinese market, especially the street markets, what you'll notice is people are  always bargaining. They're squabbling, they're trying to get the best price. There's a lot of  conversation going on before somebody buys something. That is a process.  So by creating this messaging tool between buyer and seller, it actually replicated what  consumers were used to in terms of a marketplace. And, yes, it did create a direct contact  between buyer and seller. But that's where Taobao's business model was unique. It wasn't  about a take or commission from the transaction. It was actually generated through other  means, which was advertising and whatnot. And that proved to be very successful for Taobao.  The Taobao village phenomenon was exactly that.  Recognising that there was a phenomenon happening that we were not aware of, thanks to the  innovation and the tools that we had provided, and then helping to scale that and share it  beyond the standard sort of market that we envisioned. And the idea was to help small  businesses get online, make them part of the formal economy. But when it came to the rural  community at the time, there were 600 million people that were still living outside of cities. We  actually discovered this phenomenon was happening on its own.  There   were   young   people   that were returning to the villages and building e-commerce  businesses, and they were transforming these farm areas into vibrant economic centres. Either  they were selling their local produce, but in many cases, they were creating entirely new  industries off the back of e-commerce.  
One example I talk about in the book is in a village called Shaji, which in Jiangsu province is a  company that went from farming, but the land was not very arable. Then they went into pig  farming. So they were raising pigs to sell, but weren't very successful as well. Then they went  into recycling plastic.  So I don't know if a lot of people realise, but at one point, a lot of the developed world's plastic  garbage was sent to China for processing. So it became one big dumping ground. And what  would happen at this village is the people would then sort through the plastic in order to recycle  it. And that town became so polluted as a result of this industry that the streams had. The water  was all black, and the skies were always grey because they were burning this stuff or processing  it.  So this young man actually returned from the city where he had been working for a short time  and came back to the village and decided to actually create his own e-commerce business,  focused on DIY furniture.  He had done some research. He looked at what the demand was. He went, visited Ikea, which  was a model. He said, maybe we could actually do this and create this business here locally,  have some friends help kind of procure the materials, package it, and then sell it online over a  period of two, three years, that went from just one guy doing this and started to experience  great success, to hundreds of businesses that were created in this village that were either selling  or supporting the sale of this DIY furniture, to the point where you had people not only staying  in the villages and taking these jobs, but people coming to the village to actually work in these  industries.  So it blossomed into this huge e-commerce business, which turned into hundreds of millions of  US dollar sort of revenue. And you had many of these examples, like Shaji, happening around  villages. And so we discovered this through our research department and realised that this was  a phenomenon. And what Alibaba decided to do upon realising this is that there was a tool for  job creation in rural areas.  We developed a whole training program where we'd go out to other villages and share best  practices. We would support them through subsidies of logistics services that could then be  used to help get those regions started. And then eventually they became self-sustaining.  
And so I think it was 2009, there were probably seven of these Taobao villages, we call them. By  2021, there were over 7000 of these villages doing billions of dollars in US revenue and creating,  at that time, I think, ten to twelve million jobs in these areas.  So when we talk about doing good for society, but also creating good business, I think that for  us, this was a very good example of how we were addressing a problem, which was job  creation, wealth disparity, and empowerment of people, youth, women, those who would not  have been working otherwise vis-à-vis this technological phenomenon.  Host:  Much of Alibaba’s success is deeply rooted in its ability to keenly observe and understand the  nuances of its market. By paying close attention to consumer behaviour and local market  dynamics, Alibaba was able to create tailored solutions that resonated deeply with its audience.  These keen observations also enabled Alibaba to compete with, and eventually overtake, global  competitors like Ebay. By optimising their products to suit local preferences and being acutely  aware of cultural nuances, they were able to outpace companies that failed to adapt to the local  context.  The rural Taobao phenomenon is also a testament to how observing and responding to  grassroots   innovations   can   lead   to   profound   societal   impact.   By   empowering   rural  entrepreneurs and fostering local e-commerce ecosystems, Alibaba not only drove business  success   but   also   contributed   significantly   to job creation and economic development in  underserved areas.

Does Business Have an Obligation to Contribute to a Better World?

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Feike Sijbesma illustrated the private sector’s responsibility to meaningfully contribute toward the betterment of society as a result of the immense impact businesses have on people and the planet.Companies must go beyond performative sustainability practices, like corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, by aligning their core activities with societal contributions.Companies should identify and focus on addressing major global challenges, leveraging existing frameworks like the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).It is crucial for businesses to align their actions with their stated values to maintain credibility and trust.In our changing global landscape, companies that fail to contribute to society will face challenges in sustainability and lose the support of customers, employees, and shareholders.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Does Business have an Obligation to Contribute  to a Better World?  Elaine Fernandez:  With sustainable development taking centre stage in the global agenda, a common question  being asked is: "how can business contribute to a more sustainable future?”  In achieving this transformation, does a company’s   role extend beyond profit generation to  encompass ethical stewardship of our planet   and more sustainable business practices? For  visionary business leader Mr. Feike Sijbesma, the answer is a resounding yes.  Drawing from his experience as Honorary Chairman and former CEO of DSM   -   a purpose - led  science company specialising in solutions for health, nutrition, and bioscience   -   Mr Sijbesma  shares   his thoughts on why the private sector has a duty to contribute to the betterment of  society, and how it can be done.  Feike Sijbesma:  When I became CEO, I realised, “Hey, I have a certain impact.”  You can call it power or impact or whatever, but I felt with that impact, I also have responsibility.  And what do I do with that responsibility? In my view, companies need to contribute to a better  world and better society as well. We are part of society.   It's not that companies are   here,   and  society is there, that we are part of society and therefore we need to contribute to a better  society.  I would say to almost every company, a   young starting company. And   also,   a large existing  company. Can you justify as a founder, as a CEO, as a starter, not to contribute to society with  your company? Can you justify that? Can you allow that for your company, for the success of  your company, for the employees, but can you also   morally allow that for yourself? That means  automatically companies need to be purposeful, contribute somewhere. And if you don't know  where to contribute.
  You can look to the biggest challenges in the world. And many of the big challenges of the world  are summarised in the SDGs of the UN the 17 SDGs. And whether it is oceans or hunger or climate  or circularity or whatever it is pick, maybe not all 17. Pick o ne, two, three, where you believe that  you can contribute.  I almost insist that companies contribute to their core activities and the core competencies of a  better world. It's not that you say, well, at our core activities, we do not contribute so much to a  better society, but we have some things on the side, whic h our CSR activities or CSR report. No,  no, no.  In the core of your business, you contribute or not. Some companies say to me, yeah, easier said  by you Feike, but our company cannot contribute so much to society. Like you could maybe do  with climate and hunger, et cetera. I say to those CEOs, if your co mpany cannot contribute to  society, think about how sustainable your activities will be in the future because you will run into  difficulties.  So my wish or philosophy is as companies, you are part of society. Therefore, you have a  responsibility to contribute to a better society. Look where you can contribute from your core  activities. If you don't do that, not only society has a problem, but yo u have a problem as a  company as well.  And at the end of the day, if you don't want to do it. I think your customers will hook off. Your  employees will not work for you. The society will not give you your license to operate. And I think  that even shareholders will hook off and want to invest in   companies which contribute to a better  world. So therefore it is doing well financially by doing good for the world.  Then I add to that. Look how   consistent your   company is. Many companies say A and they often  do B. So sometimes you are pragmatic. I understand it. But by far, most of the time, if you say A,  you need to do A and not B. So have a look, where is your company saying? “Well, we are very  sustainable, bu t we don't do   this,   or we don't do that.” That is not consistent. And you might lose  your credibility. So be careful.  I have one example for myself. After three years on this journey, I said to my board, why is my  renumeration a link to financial parameters only, and not to sustainability parameters for 50%.  And my boss said, because everybody is doing that, but that's no t a good argument.
  Uh, I'm looking for consistency here. I say that I want to be sustainable. But I don't put my money  where my mouth is because my remuneration is not linked to that. That's weird. I would like to  change that. And at the end, we did change that we were one o f the front runners on this one.  Elaine Fernandez:  So, we've learned that achieving a sustainable and equitable future will require the private sector  to be a responsible steward of the power and influence it wields. As a key pillar of any well -  functioning society, the private sector has a moral responsibi lity and obligation to contribute to  its betterment.  Companies that embrace this not only contribute to a better world but position themselves for  long - term success. This is because sustainable practices are not just a desirable goal, they are fast  becoming an indispensable prerequisite for businesses to ope rate in the evolving global  landscape.  And as Mr Sijbesma points out, it isn’t enough to simply adopt sustainability in some regards.  Companies must walk - the - talk, making sustainability a central tenet in all aspects of their  practices and operations, whether it's wage compensation or investmen ts, which in turn boosts  their credibility and positions them as responsible leaders in their industry.

5 Turnarounds for a Sustainable Future

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, we learned about the five Turnarounds that must be addressed if humanity is to halt the decline of global wellbeing. Without urgent action to eliminate poverty, address inequality, empower women, and transform our food and energy systems, waning global wellbeing will continue to decline over the rest of this century.There are many existential threats that can jeopardise our sustainable future, however, humanity only has a limited amount of resources at its disposal, thus investing in the five Turnarounds is vital.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  5 Turnarounds for a Sustainable Future  Elaine Fernandez:  Based on projections made in "Earth for All", co - authored by Professor Emeritus of Climate  Strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School, Jorgen Randers, global wellbeing is declining  and will continue to decline over the next several decades unless we make   significant changes  to the way we live, work and govern our societies.  Professor Randers has distilled these changes down to 5 Turnarounds that can help us  overcome the challenges we face and improve societal and economic wellbeing. Let's take a  closer look.  Professor Jorgen Randers:  Unless we are doing something extraordinary, wellbeing is going to decline over the next 30  to 60 years. And then we are asking the question: What could be done in order to avoid the  decline? And we answer, there are five things that needs to be done, the   5 Turnarounds, as  we call them. And one is to remove global poverty, to get rid of extreme poverty through  economic development in the South.  Basically, the second one is to do something about the inequality, to turn the trend of  declining equality, which means essentially take from the rich and give to the poor. So that's  easy enough.  The third thing that needs to be done in order to ensure to avoid the fall in wellbeing, is to  empower   women.   So   basically,   make   sure   that   there   is,   for   all,   education,   health,  contraception, opportunity, what we know lowers birth rates and improves the quality of life  of people.  The fourth thing that needs to be done is to put agriculture on a more ecologically footing so  that we stop the destruction of biodiversity, cutting of the old growth forest. And that, again,  is fairly simple to do. It is essentially to shift agricultural   practices away from the current  industrialised, over - fertilised type of style to what is typically being called a regenerative  agriculture or ecological agriculture. And the important point here in passing is that this is  easily done while maintaining the   same global output of food, so that you don't need to  starve. In order to do this, you may need to consume a little less red meat in the rich world in  order to achieve this. But this is doable.
  And the fifth thing that needs to be done, according to our "Earth for All" analysis, is of course  the energy and climate side. And again, this is very simple to do in principle. It simply is  stopping using coal, oil and gas. Most of the CO2 that we emit c omes from coal, oil and gas.  And as long as we stop burning this for electricity or for heat, we solve the problem. So this  means essentially introducing sun and wind and hydro and biomass. These two latter are  small, as fast as you can. And on the questio n of whether you should use nuclear energy in  the process, is a question of taste in my mind.  So these are the 5 Turnarounds.  And our view and our model, our new world model, shows that if those five things are  implemented with strength and speed, and that means over the next 30 years, we will  maintain wellbeing, we will stop the decline in wellbeing and manage to at least keep i t level  during the rest of this century.  Elaine Fernandez:  Eliminating poverty, addressing inequality, empowering women, as well as transforming our  food and energy systems. These five areas are paramount in the fight against declining global  wellbeing. Inaction and continuing with the status quo is no longer an o ption, and so investing  on resources where they will yield the higher societal improvements is vital. As Professor  Randers has shared, we can only manage and hopefully reverse the decline in global wellbeing  if substantial change is made in these five key   areas starting today.

The Economic Hit Man: A Background 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, John Perkins described how certain developmental projects conducted by multilateral institutions like the World Bank may not always benefit lower-income nations and their poorest segments. The conventional approach of promoting large loans to lower-income countries may not always result in beneficial outcomes, especially with the diversion of funds from essential social services to benefit corporations.John Perkins, having identified the problems of this system, faced a moral dilemma between continuing with the status quo and the growing awareness of the detrimental impact on vulnerable communities.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Economic Hit Man: A Background  Rohan Hazell:  18 th   century Scottish economist and philosopher, Adam Smith, used the “invisible hand of the  free market “as a metaphor describing the wider economic benefits to society when individuals  act in their own self interests.  As John Perkins revealed in his best - selling memoir, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, behind -  the - scenes influences on the economy go well beyond Smith’s invisible hand.  Prior to becoming a best - selling author, John was the chief economist in a major consulting firm,  advising the World Bank, United Nations, Fortune 500 corporations, and governments around  the world.  We spoke to John to gain greater insight into how economic forces can be shaped and influenced  by a small global minority, and not always in ways that benefit the collective.  John Perkins:  So, you know, it's interesting how in business school I was taught and then working with the  World Bank in the early parts of my career, I was taught that if you want to help a lower income  country that has resources that your corporations would like to ge t a hold of, you want to help  that country, you convince the country to take out huge loans from what we call The Washington  Consensus, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, et cetera. But the money never  actually goes to the country. It goes to hire   our own companies, US companies, construction  companies, to build big infrastructure projects like power plants and highways and industrial  parks and so forth.  And these things for one thing, they make big profits for our companies. And they make a few  families in the country very wealthy, the families that own the industries and the commercial  establishments, but the majority of the people suffer because money i s diverted from healthcare,  education and other social services to pay off the interest on the loan. And in the end, the  principle can't be repaid. So, we go back and say, sell your resources real cheap to our  corporations, and vote with us at the United N ations. Let us build a military base on your soil.  You know, it's a very old story, and yet I believe that I didn't see all the negative aspects at the  beginning.
  I only saw the positive, which was when you invest that kind of money, you could show  statistically that the GDP grows, the economy grows, and that was interpreted as meaning that  everybody prospers. But over time, and particularly with the help of the he ad of state of Panama,  Omar Torrijos, and a few other individuals who exposed me to the truth, I saw the negative  aspects, the fact that these statistics are a lie.  They don't provide information about true prosperity. It's only the prosperity of the rich. And  you know, I'd say that as a good example. Today in the United States, three individuals have as  much wealth as half the US population. If those three individua ls made 10% on their investments  on their wealth last year, and half the country lost 3% and everybody else remained the same, it  would show an overall growth of almost 4%.  So the statistics, if you're measuring by our current metrics, which would indicate that there's  prosperity for everyone when in fact, only three individuals made all the money and everybody  else either remained the same or lost. But it took me a long time   to realise that because the story  is told that it's not that way.  Finally, after seven years in that job, more or less, I began to understand the truth behind it. But  then I was stuck in the system. I was making a lot of money. I was travelling first class around the  world. I grew up a relatively poor teachers’ son, you   know, I wasn't impoverished, but in rural  New Hampshire, in the United States. And, suddenly I'm just living the life of what seemed like  the American dream, and I didn't want to admit that I knew what I knew. But over the next couple  of years, my conscien ce really got to me. So, on my 10th year in that job, I quit and they made it  very hard for me to quit from many different aspects.  But I did eventually quit, and I began to write this book. I decided to write an expose. I contacted  other people who had jobs like mine and the people we call the “jackals” who, if the economic  hitmen don't succeed in convincing governments leaders to acc ept these huge loans that the  people go in who threaten coups and assassinations, and actually do them sometimes as you well  know. And the United States has a history and in many parts of the world, Iran, Indonesia, Chile,  many places, certainly a lot of i nvolvement in the Philippines and many places.  So, I began to contact these people to include them in the book, and I was then contacted myself.  I received phone calls, anonymous phone calls which threatened my life and my infant daughter.  And I took this threat seriously because I knew what these peop le could do. I was terrified.  At the same time, the president of a major consulting firm, an engineering consulting firm in  Boston, one of the largest in the United States, and perhaps the world at the time that had been  a competitor of my company, this president of this company, Stone   & Webster Engineering  Company, invited me out to dinner. And he said, you know, you got a great resume. You were  Chief Economist at one of our rivals. We'd like to use your resume in our proposals. You don't  have to do anything for us or very little for u s. Just let us use your resume and I'm prepared to  write you a cheque for half a million dollars tomorrow morning as a consultant's retainer.
  This is the late 80s, you know, half a million is nothing to laugh at today, but it was a lot more  back then. So, my life is being threatened and I'm being offered this money and the president of  this company turns to me and he says, you know, you just can 't write that book.  So, I   am   getting exactly what Presidents of these countries have gotten. I   am   getting the  opportunity of a bribe to make a lot of money, a legal bribe because the consultants' retainers  are perfectly legal, and at the same time, I   am   getting threatened. So I took the bribe. And, you  know, in all fairness, I   would   say I did   not   put it toward buying a car, fancy cars or, or big houses  I put it toward doing what I had done as a Peace Corps volunteer several years earlier and went  back to the Amazon Rainforest where I lived for a couple of years as a Peace Corps volunteer and  volun teered to help them save their forests and form a non - profit and wrote books about them.  I wrote five books   -   Shapeshifting, The World Is As You Dream It   -   books about what was going  on in the Amazon, that was okay with Stone & Webster, but I didn't write   the   book. And then  many years later my contract had expired, and I was in the Amazon on 9/11. And when I came  home I went to Ground Zero.  And as I looked at that smouldering pit, I knew I had to write about what I had done, but this time  I decided I wouldn't contact anybody else. I would do it completely secretly, completely in private,  and it couldn't be an expose. It would have to be a per sonal story, a confession.  So, I wrote it as a confession and without anybody knowing. And I figured once I had it in the  hands of a good agent in New York and he was sending it up to publisher, it would be my best  insurance policy because you know, the National Security Agency, the   CIA, organisations like that,  the last thing they want is for a book like that to get a lot of attention and if its author can die  mysteriously it's going to sell a lot of copies.  Rohan Hazell:  National and international economic decisions are not shaped solely by market forces, but are  also greatly influenced by powerful actors in government and business.  As John Perkins has shared, these influences aren’t always beneficial, and can serve the interests  of a minority, rather than the collective.

Shaking the Foundations: Moving Towards New Economic Approaches 

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Korten critiqued the historical colonisation of resources, which has persisted in the current global economy. He suggested that businesses should align with communities, advocating for local ownership and challenging conventional notions of private property.A profound shift is proposed in the understanding of economics, emphasising biology and ecology as foundational to economics. This is in contrast to the current finance-centric view.Local-level actions, beyond individual lifestyle changes, are emphasised. From agriculture to transport, the goal is a comprehensive rethinking of every aspect of life at the local level.Professor Korten calls for a recognition that individuals can be sources of creativity, but their existence depends on community interdependence. He proposes a melding of Eastern and Western perspectives on individuality and collectivism.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Shaking the Foundations:  Moving Towards New Economic Approaches  Rohan Hazell:  It is well known that governments and transnational corporations have exploited resources for  profit, often at the expense of local communities and the environment.  Former Harvard Business School Professor David Korten proposes that an effective way to  change this is to question the norms of property and private ownership, advocating instead for  Earth's resources as a common.  In this video, he will also examine the practical aspects of reshaping our everyday lives,  including transitioning to regenerative agriculture and restructuring transportation systems.  Prof. David Korten:  Now, part of the implication of that is that essentially, we need to all learn to live within the  means of our own ecosystems. We have to think bio-regionally. A major part of the dynamic of  the empire has been the colonisation of other people's resources to extract for the benefit of  the coloniser. And that is still the dynamic of our current global economy.  And   transnational   corporations,   they're   sometimes   fraudulently   called   multinational,   but  they're not multinational, they're not national. Everywhere they are transnational. They don't  give a damn about the wellbeing of any group of local people. All they want is the profits for  their absentee owners, who themselves have no idea, even most of them, what corporations  they own or what that corporation is doing to their community.  But this begins to get us into the depth of the reorganisation that we need to make. How do we  organise business? Well, business organisations are the organisations by which we actually  create our livelihood. But business has to be aligned with the community, which means that  ultimately our businesses need to be owned by local people who live in the communities in  which the business does business, and which have an inherent interest, not their means of  becoming a billionaire, but their means of feeding themselves and their family.  
And so we begin to rethink at the deepest level, what do we mean by property? And what do  we mean by private property? Does private property mean the ultimate freedom to do any  damn thing we want with the land that we own? Or does it recognise that much of Earth is a  common, much of our knowledge as a common?  None of us created the soil, or the sources of water or the source of our climate, but we all  depend on them. So how do we learn to control, in a sense, control ourselves, so that we  manage them in ways that are mutually beneficial and supportive of life? But this gets us into  the very deepest issues of rethinking our most foundational legal frameworks, economic  frameworks, and the need for a whole new economics.  If we think of economics as our tools for managing our relationships, by which we create our  means of living. Wow. That begins, you know, instead of finance being the foundational of  economics, you know, biology and ecology are the foundations. And we need to really think in  terms of, oh, economics. That's e-co-no-mics, ecology, economics. Ah, wow, how different that  is. It's not about making money; it's about making a living. And maybe sometimes money is a  useful tool, but to make the growing of these numbers, we call money the purpose of the  economy. Again, what were we ever thinking?  You know, part of it is having these conversations in terms of a local level. It's not, you know,  what can you do by eat less meat, buy an electric car? but rather it's the kinds of meetings that  are happening at the local level in which people are saying, what can we do to support our local  farmers and support the transition to regenerative agriculture, which does not make use of  pesticides and chemical fertilisers, but deals with the regenerative processes of Earth?  How do we begin to restructure our transportation systems, not just to have electric cars, but  actually to eliminate our need for cars? I mean, I lived for a number of years in New York City  with no car at all. And, you know, it worked great. Anybody that wants a car in New York City has  got to be a little stupid because essentially everything that we needed was in a short walking  distance of our apartment.  And if we needed to go further, we had a wonderful public transportation system that would get  us there very, very rapidly. And if we begin to rethink every aspect of our lives in these terms,  it's not easy to restructure a city, to eliminate dependence on cars, but that's part of the process  that we need to work on locally and we begin to make more use of bikes, structure our  neighbourhoods in ways that reduce our need to take further trips and so forth.  
It's a very fundamental question. Like all these things, it has a very simple answer in a way that  once you get deeper into it, becomes impossibly complex. But as part of understanding our  nature as humans, we humans are creatures of our mind, our imagination. And one of the  things I learned living around the world is the extraordinary difference in cultures, and they  have the deepest impact on how we see one another and see the world and how we respond.  Now, in terms of your focus on essentially developing a non-Western dominated framework for  economics or development, which makes a lot of sense, but here's kind of a deeper thing that I  learned in our western cultures. This is kind of a generalisation, but the dominant culture is very  individualistic. And one of the things that I learned during my time in Asia, particularly in the  Southeast Asia countries, is that the identity is less individual and more the community and the  family. I am a member of a community, from my experience, that's deteriorating, but it was  traditionally very, very strong.  Now where we need to go currently is a recognition that the individual is a source, or can be a  source of wonderful, useful creativity. And yet my existence as an individual depends on the  group. So I also have to be a member of the community and recognise my community identity  and recognise that it's a hierarchy of communities.  Ultimately, we are a one earth community, but it starts from our local communities that have an  essential interdependence on the immediate actions that are necessary to create and maintain  our lives. So ultimately it's the melding of that Eastern and Western perspective.  Rohan Hazell:  The   global economy is dominated by multinational corporations, and there is increasing  pressure on these organisations to realign with the wellbeing of local communities.  This realignment will require broad, sweeping changes regarding governance and ownership,  the nature of private property, sustainable transport and energy production, and many more.  The search for solutions must strike a balance between two broad social orientations: Western  individualism and Eastern collectivism. A middle way that integrates these two approaches can  help us recognise and leverage the interdependence of the individual, the community, our  institutions, and our natural world.

The Impetus for a Post-Western World Order

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, GIFT.ed Chairman Chandran Nair delved into the culminating causal factors - like soaring global populations and climate change - rendering the current rules-based world order untenable, thus setting the stage for an impending multipolar world.The exponential increase in global population over the past seven decades has created demands for a more inclusive global order that considers the diverse needs of people all around the world.Climate change, and its varying degrees of impact on different nations, is a significant driver of political change. This is prompting countries to re-evaluate existing international agreements, seeking new rules that reflect their unique vulnerabilities, contributions, and development needs.The rapid advancement of technology has altered global power dynamics. Emerging technological powers like South Korea are challenging the traditional dominance of the West, leading to tensions over influence in areas such as the internet and telecommunications.Growing dissatisfaction with the principles of free-market capitalism, especially in light of events like the Russia-Ukraine War, has led to significant fluctuations in energy prices, underscoring the need for new economic paradigms that prioritise fairness and stability.The concept of de-Westernisation does not imply hostility towards the West but rather a recognition of historical power imbalances and the need for a more inclusive, multipolar world order.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  The Impetus for a Post-Western World Order  Rohan Hazell:  The foundations that prop up the current 'world order' are shifting.  Against a backdrop of rising multipolarity, nationalism and populism, countries excluded from  the inception of our current rules-based order, are increasingly demanding a seat at the table.  So, what are the catalysts driving this shift?  Chandran Nair, Chairman of GIFT.ed, takes us through some of these factors.  Chandran Nair:  Well, the transition in terms of the need for a new world order is in many ways inevitable. When  the current rules-based order post-Second World War was created, the world's population was  about 3 billion at most. In the space of 70 years, that population has more than doubled around  the world, not equally. In some parts of the world, it has quadrupled.  So if you're in India, in 1947, the Indian population was about 330 million. Today it's more than  1.3 billion. That's four times. Therefore, they are confronted with challenges that are so  profound and so large. And because they are large, like a China or like Brazil or like a Russia,  they want and demand a different say in how the world runs because their needs are very  different and they do not want to be, in their view at least, seen as subjects of an old order in  which a few nations dictate to them what should be done and how the world operates.  Then, now we have climate change. Climate change is profoundly affecting countries and in very  different ways. And many of the discussions about how climate should be addressed are being  formulated in ways that some see as not to the advantage, not even recognising that they were  not part of creating the problem in the first place. We are all part of the problem to different  degrees, so they want different rules.  
Then there's the issue, which we all know about technology. I'm particularly referring to that  sort of digital technology wars. When this all came about 20 years ago, we thought that there  would be a democratisation of technology around the world, that the technology would be for  everyone. But that was a naive idea, because in that rules-based sort of echo chamber of  thinking, it was always viewed that a certain group of countries, particularly the United States,  would dominate that sphere and it would be mainly due to its largesse that it would share it  with the world.  But as we've now seen, other countries have become very advanced in some areas, far  outstripping the United States in some of their technologies. This includes China, smaller  nations like Korea even. And they are looking to essentially use and deploy their technologies  around the world for different reasons, partly market, partly part of seeing it as a global good  that they could share. This has created tensions unexpectedly, because the countries that felt  that they were ahead of everybody else, did not anticipate nations that were once seen as poor,  backward, technologically not advanced, reaching a point that they could compete.  Technology has become a frontier for control. Who runs the Internet? Where can we have  Huawei? And where can we have Google? And then there's Indian tech companies, Korean tech  companies and all of those.  Finally, it's the nature of capitalism itself. Many countries are not happy with the ideas about  free markets. Even in Europe, there's a big tension now because of the Russia-Ukraine war.  Energy prices in some parts have gone up by five to ten times. So in those countries, even in  Europe, there's a feeling, like I was speaking to a very esteemed member of the Club of Rome  just this week, that energy prices in Norway, which we all know is energy-rich, have gone up by  10%. And I said, why? Well, he said, because we are part of the EU, the common market. So the  market now is dictating to an energy-rich country what their price of energy will be. And you  can imagine the average Norwegian is saying, why do we belong to this market? Well, all these  market theories were part of the rules-based order. A European version of it was created.  So sometimes people do use the word "de-Westernisation". And I want to be clear that you  understand that when we say de-Westernisation, it's not anti-west. This is a very dangerous way  of thinking. What we mean by de-Westernisation is to understand history and understanding  history, to say that we've had 400 to 500 years of the domination of Western powers, that is  history. That is a fact.  
What we now have is a need to be more inclusive, have a multipolar world with different  representations of different cultures, history, economic needs, all of that brought into a  platform so that we strive for peace, stability and fairness for people around the world in an era  of existential threats.  So the de-Westernisation that people are talking about, if I can simplify it, is to say the Western  powers can't dominate. That time is over. That time of Western domination was facilitated  through military aggression and great violence and overlooking all sensibilities with regard to  fairness and rule of law.  That was colonisation. That's in the past.  And so when we talk about de-Westernisation, it's not a zero sum game. It's really a negotiated  multilateral system whereby countries come together and understand we need a new operating  system more suited to what the 21st century will be very different.  Rohan Hazell:  The current rules-based world order was created after the Second World War, when the global  population was around 3 billion. In the last 70 years, however, a lot has changed.  First, the global population has more than doubled, and in some parts of the world, populations  have quadrupled.  Second, climate change has started impacting nations around the world.  Third, the rise of digital technology is creating unexpected tensions between nations.  Lastly, countries are increasingly dissatisfied with the results of modern capitalism.  Collectively, these changes mean that different countries want a say in how the world runs,  marking the emergence of a “post-Western” world..  While a post-Western world may imply the West will lose out, this is not necessarily the case.  What it does mean is a greater diversity of cultures, ideas, and solutions towards achieving  global security, stability and prosperity.

Sustainability Myths: Part 2

### keyTakeaway
We explored two further “myths” about sustainability: that the free market alone can address sustainability challenges, and that technology is a cure-all.Myth #3: The ‘Invisible Hand’ will Solve our Sustainability Problem - Unregulated markets often prioritise short-term profit over long-term sustainability goals.- This inherent limitation means companies aim to produce goods and services cost-effectively for profit, not necessarily to provide public goods or address sustainability.Myth #4: Technology is the Panacea- Although technological advancement presents great opportunities for sustainability, many technologies are either nonexistent, too expensive, or underperforming at scale.- Relying solely on technology can lead to a shirking of responsibility by governments, businesses, and individuals to address the root causes of the challenges we face today.

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  Sustainability Myths: Part 2  Elaine Fernandez :  In the last chapter we debunked two big myths of sustainability: the belief in a universal  understanding of sustainability; and that consumption - driven growth can ever be sustainable.  In this chapter, we’ll explore two more myths, which deal with how solutions to sustainability  challenges are envisaged. In particular, that the free market and technology will be the  primary levers to solve society’s challenges.  Myth 3: The ‘Invisible Hand will Solve our Sustainability Problem  The realisation that the ‘invisible hand’ of the free market and initiatives like environmental,  social and governance ESG investing can single - handedly address sustainability challenges is  a myth increasingly coming to light.  In the last chapter, we established the need to decouple economic growth from resource  consumption. Yet, for the most part, markets are not incentivised to do this and instead  prioritise short term profit, which can undermine long term sustainability goals . The  assumption that markets and companies will generate effective solutions to society's  challenges is based on the invisible hand, which is that in pursuit of profits, businesses will  inevitably allocate resources to innovation in the areas of climate c hange, pollution, access to  basic needs and so on.  However, historically speaking, unregulated business activity does not take into account social  or environmental externalities, and is consequently a major driver of sustainability challenges.  That doesn't mean business is bad, but even if the free market   encourages business activity  to become more sustainable, it does not address the root causes.  Sustainability has been likened to a public good, which is a service provided to society without  profit in mind. Corporations, by their very nature, are not built to do this. Rather, they are  built to produce goods and services as cheaply as possible in or der to sell more. At a systemic  level, the result is that markets are incentivised to disguise the failure to reduce negative  outcomes of economic activity by offsetting.  An example of this exists in the carbon trading market, in which carbon offsetting by planting  trees or capturing CO2 is used to preserve the status quo. But fundamentally, there is not an  economic equivalent between CO2 emissions and offsets. Simply put,   there are not enough
  trees in the world to offset society's carbon, and nor will there ever be, especially if  populations in lower - income countries seek to emulate the consumption levels of high -  income countries.  The core issue is this, at the moment, it is impossible to make products without also releasing  CO2. More generally, it is also impossible to consume goods and services without also  depleting our resource base. This is in part due to a social behaviour whi ch is termed the  'tragedy of the commons'. This basically means that a public resource like our air quality, has  been abused by governments, businesses and people because no one owns it.  This applies to other resources like fishing and seawater quality. It has also manifested in  another tragedy –   the 'tragedy of the horizon'. As highlighted in a landmark 2015 speech by  the former governor of the bank of England, Mark Carney. The concept was   simple. Climate  change creates tremendous risks for financial markets, but these mounting risks are ignored  by investors due to the market's tendency towards a short term outlook.  This is seen in climate change, but also in other critical sustainability challenges like pollution,  biodiversity loss and more. In summary, the fact that markets cannot perform optimally when  presented with existential threats is a well - known economic the ory. However, this does not  mean markets have no role to play in facilitating sustainability. Rather, governments and  consumers will eventually have to demand changes that place limits on socially and  environmentally destructive economic activity, and mark ets will respond in kind. Now we'll  move on to the final myth that technology can be a cure all for our sustainability challenges.  Myth 4: Technology is the Panacea  When faced with the realities that there is no universal understanding of sustainability, or  that our prevailing economies and markets are not well suited to solving society's challenges,  it can be tempting to resort to the belief that advancements in tech nology will provide the  answer. This is the fourth and final myth we'll be exploring together.  The reality is many of the technologies we envisage to help address sustainability challenges  do not even exist yet. Or if they do exist, their uptake and impact at scale has been  underwhelming at best. Take carbon capture and storage, or CCS. This technol ogy captures  carbon as it's produced and stores it. The world's largest direct air capture plant came online  in 2022, and it can collect about 4000 tonnes of CO2 a year, about as much CO2 as is emitted  globally every 4 seconds.  To put things into perspective, we would need almost 8 million of these high tech, high cost  facilities to capture all the CO2 we emit on an annual basis. Although CCS and similar  technologies can be used to reduce emissions for companies and countries ali ke, they are also  often far too expensive for the global majority and cannot be replicated around the world at  sufficient scale and speed to achieve the impact in the time frames needed.
  Another example is in the green transformation towards using renewable energy. While this  transformation can go a long way towards reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, it's expected  that this shift to green technologies will require a 400% to 600% increa se in the amount of  critical   minerals   we   use   today.   Needless   to   say,   this   would   have   significant   social,  environmental and geopolitical implications.  The lack of pragmatic, cost effective and adaptable tech solutions has not stopped the march  towards large scale technological solutions like geoengineering, despite their potential for  unknown and damaging consequences. For example, in 2022, the US Nation al Academies of  Sciences recommended allocating up to 200 million US dollars to explore how light reflecting  particles could be injected into the upper atmosphere to reduce the amount of sunshine the  Earth receives as a means of cooling down the planet.  The potential consequences of this are unknown and could impact the whole world in ways  that are impossible to foresee. Ultimately, while technological innovation remains essential  to address sustainability challenges, we cannot put all our eggs in one bas ket. The  perpetuation of the myth that technology is a silver bullet for sustainability makes it easier  for public and private sector leadership, as well as the average person, to abdicate  responsibility to address existential threats like climate change.   This is easier than accepting  the reality that government intervention limits consumption and transforming the way we  run our economies is the only viable solution.  As we navigate the complex landscape of sustainability, it is essential to recognise and address  the myths that can hinder progress towards a more sustainable world. To effectively redesign  society, governments, businesses, civil societies and consumers ne ed to look beyond the  status quo and challenge beliefs that may be deeply rooted in our collective understanding of  sustainability.  In the next and final chapter of this core module, we'll hear again from Professor Jeffrey Sachs,  president of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, on how we can start to  reimagine sustainability.

Redesigning Economic Systems

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, you learned that addressing the existential threats facing humanity requires moving from focusing on their impacts to addressing their root causes: our economic, governance, and societal systems.The global economic system encompasses various elements like trade bodies, financial markets, currencies, and supply chains. Redesigning the economy involves reevaluating how the economy operates, including its underlying purpose, to create systems that serve both people and the planet. Inequality is closely linked to the current economic model. Profound wealth disparities are a result of a system that disproportionately benefits capital holders and the wealthy. A critical part of redesigning the economy will require us to create more democratic frameworks that ensure equitable sharing of resources. The current economic model is premised on driving overconsumption, which poses challenges for a planet with finite resources and a growing population. Economic growth is intertwined with consumption, and the current metrics of success - like GDP - are based on principles that are leading to further damage to societal and planetary wellbeing. Alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator, need to be considered to better measure wellbeing and factor in resource distribution and non-market activities. This change is essential for developing more meaningful policy discussions.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Redesigning Economic Systems  Elaine Fernandez:  In the previous two modules, we explored the six drivers of change and the 10 existential  threats facing humanity. But the global effort to redesign society isn't just about problems, it's  also about solutions. So what can we do? This is where systemic transformation comes in. If we  want to create lasting resilience in our communities, organisations and countries. We need to  move from addressing impacts to addressing the root causes, which are economic, governance,  and societal systems.  As you'll hear from global experts across this module, these systems impact everything. From  the price of our food, to our happiness levels, and the government policies that affect you and  your organisation. We'll start with the system that needs the greatest overhaul: our global  economic system.  Our global economic system comprises the trade of goods and services, financial markets,  currencies, supply chains, and the organisations that make it all possible. When talking about  redesigning the economy, we need to take all of these factors into consideration, as well as the  underlying beliefs as to how an economy should work, and what purpose it should serve.  To answer that, we'll first hear from renowned development economist Prof. Jayati Ghosh, who  is professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, on the need to create  economies that serve people and the planet.  Prof. Jayathi Gosh:  The economy is a human construct, and that means it can be shaped and changed, and the  rules by which it operates can be altered by humans, by societies. And we need to think of  making the economy work for us, for people, for society, for a just, humane, sustainable society.  Instead of thinking what we have to do to conform to the requirements of this economy, we  have to say, well, we have economic arrangements, how do we change those arrangements so  as to enable the greater good of all? So as to enable life on this planet, to enable us to avoid  extreme ecological destruction?  
So obviously we have to do something. What does that mean? It means that we must create a  framework for the economy to function which does not necessarily privilege Those who are  already wealthy, those who hold capital, and those who can thereby influence governments to  make those rules and regulations in their own favour.  We have to have a more democratic framing of laws, rules, regulations, which gives greater  opportunities for all, which ensures a more equitable sharing of the economic pie and which  does   not   stifle   the   growth   of   small,   micro, medium enterprises of individuals who are  self-employed and of those who are working for wages for a living.  Elaine Fernandez:  As Prof. Gosh has explained, the economy is a human construct and that means it's within our  power to transform and improve it by finding a balance between economic value creation and  the long-term needs of people and the planet. She also touched on the critical issue of  economic inequality. At the systemic level, this is an outcome of our current economic model  that needs a redesign.  Let's explore this further with Prof. David Korten, best-selling author and former professor of  the Harvard Business School.  Prof. David Korten:  In March 2022, Forbes magazine identified a global total of 2,668 billionaires with a combined  wealth of 12.7 trillion. That's trillion with a T, dollars, up significantly from the 2,096 billionaires  it had identified in 2020, just two years earlier, before COVID became a global pandemic. Now  the United States is leading the world with 735 billionaires with a collective 4.7 trillion in  financial assets, and China is close second. So here's the joining of East and West, the United  States and China. China's a close second, with 607 billionaires holding 2.3 trillion in assets. So  together our two countries account for 56 percent of the total assets of the world's billionaires.  Now, we've created a system in which the richer you are, the more likely you are to grow, still  richer. And we're seeing that play out in these most dynamic and destructive ways. And the  poorer you are, the more likely you're going to be forced into ever greater debt. And I assume  you're familiar with the Global Footprint Network, which says that even though we are so far  from meeting the needs of most of the world's people, our human consumption currently  exceeds Earth's limits 1.7 times what Earth can sustain.  
And yet, In the midst of this, we're failing to meet the most basic needs of most people. So this  is, this is the most dramatic evidence I can imagine of the fundamental failures of our current  economic theories and practice. And the more we consume, the faster GDP grows and the  faster Earth dies.  Elaine Fernandez:  Prof. Korten has helped us establish that inequality is intimately linked to how our economic  systems are designed. He also mentioned the issue of consumption. On a planet of finite  resources, and a growing population, our levels of consumption are impossible to continue for  the long term, especially in higher income countries.  Yet, economic growth remains inseparable from consumption. Let's hear more from GIFT.ed  chairman, Chandran Nair.  Chandran Nair:  The way we think about growth, GDP, is reliant on getting people to produce more, to consume  more. If you take, for example, the production of food. So if you're producing food and your  production methods are very wasteful because you're reliant on an economic model that  encourages people to over-consume because the more they consume, the more you can sell.  So you find ways by which to produce more, and built into that is a great amount of wastage  because that's the only way you can get people to, to buy more at a cheaper price.  Elaine Fernandez:  Clearly decoupling consumption from economic growth will be one of the major challenges of  the 21st century. Where can we begin with such a transformation? Leading thinkers around the  world suggest starting with the way we fundamentally view and measure growth. In other  words, moving beyond Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, as the primary indicator of economic  success.  Prof. Robert Costanza of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London explains  more.  
Robert Costanza:  Our primary measure of progress of, you know, GDP, Gross Domestic Product which is just  measuring the amount of monetised, you know, sales and consumption of goods and services in  the economy, not really measuring wellbeing. It was never designed to measure the wellbeing  of the economy.  I mean, even the architects of GDP acknowledged that from the very beginning and warned  against using it for that purpose. And yet that's what's driving a lot of our national policies in  almost every country. And we know that, you know, a lot of what's measured in GDP should  better be thought of as a cost rather than a benefit.  And there are several alternative indicators that have been developed. One that is used is  something called the genuine progress indicator, which adjusts for the distribution of income.  So it recognises, you know, that distribution is a factor, and that not all, you know, not all  income is the same in terms of producing welfare.  It adds some things that are important things that are left out of GDP, like volunteer work and  household labour, you know, major things in many economies that They're not given credit  because they're not marketed. And then it subtracts a bunch of things that should definitely be  thought of as cost. The cost of air and water pollution, the cost of environmental destruction,  you know, the cost of CO2 emissions, and the cost of crime, you know, et cetera.  And when you do that, you find that in many countries, you know, that genuine progress has  not been improving, you know, for, for decades now. Those negative side effects of GDP growth,  cancels out their positive impact. And so, we need to get those kinds of alternative measures,  you know, much more into the policy discussion.  Elaine Fernandez:  Across this chapter, we've introduced some of the key elements of our economic systems that  are in need of a redesign. These include understanding that the purpose of the economy is to  benefit people and the planet, that we have to phase out the stark inequalities created by our  current economic activity.  That we must move beyond purely consumption driven growth. And finally, we need to  fundamentally rethink the way we measure economic progress and prosperity. The methods we  
use to achieve this redesign will be largely country-specific. But regardless of where a redesign  takes place, it can't be successful without effective governance systems that can manage the  complexity of the transformation required.  This is what we'll cover in the next chapter.

Adaptation and Mitigation as a Green Transformation

### keyTakeaway
We learned about adaptation and mitigation strategies, and why both are needed to address the impacts of climate change and environmental crises.Mitigation of existential threats means limiting their impact, while adaptation implies changing the way we organise our societies to manage impacts once they occur. The two often go hand in hand.A “green economy” is something all governments should see as an opportunity, with a focus on approaches to production and consumption that benefit both the economy and the environment.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Adaptation and Mitigation as a Green Transformation  Elaine Fernandez:  To combat the sustainability challenges of our time, countries around the world are increasingly  looking to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies.  But what exactly are these? Mitigation strategies limit the risk of threats occurring in the first  place. For example, by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we produce, we mitigate the risk  of runaway climate change.  Adaptation strategies on the other hand, are actions that reduce the impacts of threats even  while   they're   affecting   people   and   the   planet. For example, several countries, including  Singapore and the Netherlands are building costly seawalls to protect their coastlines against  rising sea levels.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies often work in tandem to minimise the risk and impacts of  sustainability challenges, like pollution. It's also important to bear in mind that these strategies  may not address the root causes that lead to sustainability challenges in the first place.  As a global community, we need to design our economies and our societies to consume less first  and foremost.  To explore mitigation and adaptation strategies further, you'll hear from Erik Solheim, former  Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, who shares his perspective on  progress being made around the world.  Erik Solheim:  The old idea was of course that if you want to develop, bring everyone out of poverty, there was  a price to be paid in the destruction of nature. There was no way to prosperity without basing  your economy on coal. The United Kingdom, which started the industrial revolution has an  abundance of coal under the water ways to bring the coal around. That's one of the main  reasons why the industrial revolution happened in the United Kingdom in the 18th century.  
We all get it wrong because economists tell us that you need to destroy nature and base it on  oil, fossil fuels. If you want to go green, the environmentalists said yes, that's right. But to me  protecting nature is much more important. But if the choice is between development and  protecting nature, 95% of the population, every nation, has shown itself to be giving a priority  to development. That's why we need to bring this into the win-win propositions of the future  where we create prosperity and jobs, but at the same time taking much better care of Mother  Earth,   which   feeds us all. Now with the 21st century, we have all the policies, all the  technologies, and all the finances to bring everyone into prosperity while at the same time  taking care of Mother Earth.  And a green economy is a closer economy where you do not destroy nature. On the contrary,  you repair nature and where you do not destroy people's health through pollution, you create  economic growth without pollution. And the main areas are in energy transport, agriculture,  and a circular economy where you don't throw away everything. We cannot continue to throw  away every mobile phone that we have used but to use the components in the form for new  products.  So, when you add all these components, you have a complete green economy where we repair  nature rather than destroy nature.  By far, the most important thing is to look for the win-wins. All the policies that are good for the  environment, good for the economy, and good for people's wellbeing and life at the same time.  One example may be city development - look to what cities people want to live in. Those are the  cities where you can walk, where you can bicycle, where there is good public transport, and  which are people-centred. Some European cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, some Eastern  European cities, Ljubljana, they are like that. The same is Shenzhen in China, Singapore,  Southeast Asia, and Hyderabad which was just declared a green city of the world, that’s an  Indian city, in 2022.  And that's focusing on the win-win because these cities attract more people, they prosper  faster, they are among the richest cities in the world, while at the same time being among the  greener cities and the cities with most joy and best health. Because you can find the same in  basically every other area but look for the win-wins. You cannot be successful if you try to see  economy and ecology as opposite forces. They must be seen as moving together into a future  where the world is much greener, much more in harmony with nature, where we apply the  learnings from all the great religions, whether it's Hinduism, Islam, or Christianity of taking care  of Mother Earth. We apply that in the same way as we are bringing people into prosperity.  So, that change of thinking, I think, is the most important, and that's why I'm also quite  optimistic because some of the top leaders like President Xi of China and Prime Minister Modi  of India, and some western leaders that fully understand this win-win proposition.  
Yes, you have some political leaders who don't understand it. You have some business leaders  who don't understand it, but it's taking hold more.  If you look at the successful developing nations, China's one, but India is the other. They see an  opportunity in going green. They don't see a huge problem and it's not a problem to be solved,  but an opportunity to be had. And interestingly enough, while China and India are loggerheads  in a number of issues when it comes to the green policies, they're very much in line because  what President Modi is doing in India is a lot of the same as what President Xi is doing in China,  using the state as a vehicle to drive green development. In India, Prime Minister Modi has  launched a number of what is called missions.  That, in my view, is very much the same as what South Korea did at the time of their fantastic  industrial development, using the state as a way to prioritise. He has made a mission for green  hydrogen, a mission for electric battery production, a mission for electric vehicles, where some  companies get access to the political leadership, and they get subsidies to drive the direction.  Well, of course, any other companies are also welcomed to go in the same direction. But some  companies are picked to be potential winners. And that's to see an opportunity to create jobs,  bring every Indian out of poverty into prosperity by going green. If you see the green  transformation as an opportunity, you will be the winner.  And that's why China and India are likely to be winners while some developing nations who  basically   sit   down,   ask   for   some   handouts   from   the   rich   part   of   the   world,   they   are  unfortunately, highly unlikely to be successful because the handouts from the rich will be very  limited. And you cannot base your development on development aid. It must be based on  making the domestic conditions for green growth.  Elaine Fernandez:  The green transformation speaks to the fact that today, we have all the policies, technologies,  and finances to deliver moderate prosperity while managing our impact on the environment.  But despite these steps in the right direction, most countries are still reliant on outdated models  that see the economy and ecology as opposing forces.  To become more sustainable, we should see the green transformation as an opportunity to  create new jobs, bring people out of poverty, and preserve the natural world.

From Marketplace to Ecosystem: Systems Thinking for Innovation

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Brian Wong delved into how Alibaba's focus on systems thinking was the cornerstone of its innovative products, services and work culture.Systems thinking helped Alibaba's transformation from a simple marketplace to a comprehensive ecosystem. This framework allowed it to identify and address unmet needs in the market by recognising the interconnection and interdependence of various components.Alibaba's innovations, such as Alipay for secure payments and Cainiao for logistics, stemmed from recognising gaps within its ecosystem. By leveraging technology to fill these gaps, the company created a seamless integration of services.Fostering a culture of problem-solving and intrapreneurship enabled employees to identify problems and pursue creative solutions. This culture empowered Alibaba’s employees to drive the company's evolution and contribute to its growth.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  From Marketplace to Ecosystem:  Systems-Thinking for Innovation  Host:  All organisations operate within systems. From a macroscopic vantage, it’s easy to see the  individual components of systems, their roles, and their interdependencies. Yet, more often  than not, we overlook the intricate connections and dependencies in the systems we interface  with daily.  This oversight can be particularly detrimental in the private sector, whose externalities have  historically caused significant societal and environmental impacts. Now, let’s explore how one of  the world's largest e-commerce giants, Alibaba, leveraged systems thinking to transform itself  from a simple marketplace into a comprehensive ecosystem, with one of its top former  executives, Brian Wong.  Brian, who served as Special Assistant to the Chairman of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma, is also the  author of the bestselling book “The Tao of Alibaba".  Brian A. Wong:  It was interesting because there was a shift from just when the company started, it was just a  marketplace, and then they thought of themselves as a platform, and then they thought of  themselves as an ecosystem. And I think what Jack, at the time, he wanted us to think about our  business and the ecology that we were trying to create vis-à-vis things like marketplace,  payment, logistics, but also kind of the larger picture of how business leaders and managers  think about the role of their company in larger society.  And I remember one time I asked him, why are we venturing into things like media and film?  And he said, well, Brian, if you want to think about this in the big picture, commerce has filled  people's pockets with lots of money, but their hearts are empty. And the problem is they don't  have a value system that thinks about sustainability and long-term growth of a company and  doing the right thing.  
He said, therefore, we need to figure out how to create positive messages through media to  help people think about their value sets. And I was like, well, that's interesting. That's going far  beyond just buying and selling stuff. And when he pushed for this environmental sort of  initiatives within the organisation, Alipay, for example, has this app called Ant Forest. It was  basically helping people measure their carbon footprint. And then any carbon savings that they  generate through walking or riding a bicycle, they can apply those credits to actually plant trees.  And I said, why are we spending the time on this? And he said, well, because without a clean  environment, without clean water, you cannot have a society that is healthy, and you will not  have resources to continue to power your businesses.So he was thinking that far ahead.  I think if we talk more about the macro trends that were happening, I think Jack and the  company saw how China's role was changing kind of in a larger global market environment. This  idea that there was a need for small businesses to reach the global sort of marketplaces, but  they didn't have a cost effective way of doing it.  Jack recognised that technology could play that role in creating a bridge in a low-cost bridge and  democratisation of commerce using that technology. Most people would have thought that  these challenges were too big to handle. But I think Jack and the team felt like, well, if we don't  do it, who's going to do it? And if now isn't the time, then when are we going to do this?  And I think timing wise was fortunate and opportune because of the rise of the Internet and  technology becoming something that was a factor.  The reality is Alibaba as a group is the collection of opportunities that we discovered along the  way of building, you know, the prior business. So if we look at, the first company was  Alibaba.com, it was international trade for small businesses. So that was linking one part of the  supply chain is like, you know, China and the world on a wholesale level. But then you realise,  once you solve the wholesale issue, then how do you sell retail? So that was another piece of  the value chain we built through Taobao.  But once you set up Taobao as a retail marketplace, you realise there was no adequate payment  system that existed because the banks were very rudimentary, there was no online payment.  And so there was a low sense of trust in this retail marketplace. So we had to create Alipay.  
And then once you had Alipay and you had product information, you realised, well, then the  barrier was a physical movement of products. So then we created Cainiao. And then once you  had all this data that was being collected, you realise, well, if we end up collecting this data, it's  going to be actually more expensive to manage this data using the existing basic infrastructure,  buying our own servers, licensing all these database software. So we ended up creating a cloud  computing business and our own operating system for the cloud computing business so that we  could survive. It was more out of survival.  And so all those things were derivatives of one another. And I think within a company, if you  want to create that intrapreneurship, you have to enable the employees to, one, have enough  time to identify those problems, but then empower them to pursue solutions to those  problems. And so all these businesses were spin-outs of the existing business.  And we gave these teams that we identified enough space and support to have these skunk  work projects. They would all go back to the old apartment of Jack's home, where Alibaba.com  was founded, and they would always incubate these projects within that location because we  thought it had good feng shui, they said, right, so many of them succeeded, but some of them  failed.  When they succeed, you obviously celebrate that, but when they fail, you also have to say, okay,  what did we learn from this? And Jack as a teacher cultivated that sort of environment.  Host:  As Brian shared, even in its early days, Alibaba’s visionary leader, Jack Ma, emphasised the  importance of seeing ‘the bigger picture.’  This focus on systems thinking was the cornerstone of Alibaba’s ability to identify and address  unmet needs in the market. Whether it was enabling small businesses to reach global markets  through Alibaba.com, creating the financial infrastructure for secure payments through Alipay,  or building robust infrastructure for data management through Alibaba Cloud: each innovation  stemmed from recognising the gaps within its ecosystem and leveraging technology to fill them.  By fostering a culture that encourages problem-solving and intrapreneurship, Alibaba  empowered its employees to pursue creative solutions and drive the company’s evolution from  a simple marketplace to a comprehensive ecosystem.

New Models for International Cooperation: One Belt One Road Initiative

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Wang Hui highlighted the emergence of different international frameworks of cooperation, like the One Belt One Road Initiative.The One Belt One Road Initiative is a departure from traditional models dominated by single powers or rigid structures like NATO, indicating a move towards more inclusive and participatory approaches to global cooperation.There is a pressing need for international cooperation in addressing common challenges like climate change. Such collaborative efforts are essential for finding alternative solutions to existential threats and mitigating conflicts.China’s dual-circulation strategy emphasises the importance of self-reliance domestically while also promoting international connectivity and trade. This approach recognises the importance of international markets without sacrificing national resilience.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  New Models for International Cooperation:  One Belt One Road Initiative  Rohan Hazell:  Though history is littered with past periods of multipolarity, the impending post-Western world  of the 21st century is unique as it unfolds against a backdrop of unprecedented technological  advancement, shifting geopolitical landscapes, and looming existential threats.  Navigating this complex terrain will necessitate new models of international cooperation and  diplomacy,   as   traditional   approaches   built   for   a   simpler   era   will   struggle.   These   are  unprecedented times, for which there is no blueprint. However, there are attempts to forge  innovative new partnerships that we can learn from.  Let’s hear more from Professor Wang Hui of Tsinghua University, Beijing.  Professor Wang Hui:  We need to create a certain kind of international framework and platform for these Asian  countries. Over the last decades, the regional integration were very important developments,  not only in these regions, but also in other regions. These also continued for a long time. Also,  what China did, the so-called One Belt One Road Initiative, tried to link the different regions,  different countries and cultures together and create a difference, giving you some possibilities  for the future.  When we talk about the One Belt One Road Initiative, we know that there are a lot of  discussions and a lot of research on the topic. First, the Chinese government made this very  clear. It's an initiative. It's not a Chinese project. It's a One Belt One Road Initiative, which means  that it needs different parts participating in the process. So it's an ongoing process.  It's not some project only by a single country. So that gives you a very different framework from,  if you compare NATO or some other, the old empire construction or the global order dominated  by a single power. This is very different, which means that the recognition of the achievements  
of the historical developments, the achievements of the 20th century, independent movements,  and also the recognition of the difference between the different cultures and so on and so forth,  but based on the participation.  And international cooperation became necessary, because following these developments, we  are also facing a lot of the challenges, especially the environment, climate change and so on and  so forth. So in that sense, it's urgent for human beings to sit together to find alternatives.  Because the traditional ways, on the one hand, created a lot of the fortunes, but also created a  lot   of conflicts and contradictions. The common challenges force us to think about the  alternative.  Following these, the whole monopoly, like the media and cultural monopoly is in an ongoing  process of changing the structures, because politically and culturally speaking, now the different  countries have much more productive discourse and the cultural products that are created,  which is very important. So this is already here and we can see this process. The Belt Road  Initiative also showed that so many possibilities have already emerged in the world and after all,  these   are   not   only   a   completely   new   process,   but   a   long   process.   For   example,   the  Tanzania-Zambia railroad and so on, so forth.  A   different   kind of international cooperation has already started from early history and  developed to a new phase currently. So it's state by state. As I said, that is not only a given  structure order, but an ordering process. It is an ordering process through the disorders, the  change. Through the disorders, we can create some new order.  Obviously, the first in dual-circulation is domestic means that we still need self-reliance.  We do not simply depend on global markets. We need to continue that process. This is based on  our experience from the 20th century. But on the other hand, the dual-circulation strategy also  implies that it's not only the circulation within our borders, but also connected with other  countries. So it's a dual-circulation - domestic, international and connected. So both the  regional connection within the country, but also the regional connection beyond the borders.  So I used to use two concepts to describe what I think about the orders. First is what I call China  and many other countries as a trans-systemic society. Because not only the different cultures in  China and India or other countries have different cultures, but also within China, for example,  we have different cultures, different religions, different regional customs, and so on and so forth  - dialects, thousand dialects, and different lifestyles.  
So our society is not only a totality, but based on different cultural backgrounds, but they are  interconnected   within,   and   have   shaped   our   own   country.   So   we   also   recognise   the  interconnectivities between different countries. The Belt and Road Initiative itself is a practice of  trans-societal system to some extent.  So in that sense, it's a dual-circulation strategy. It's not only a strategy, it's also based on our  framework, our philosophy about the world, and also about our own country.  Rohan Hazell:  The post-Western world calls for a new model of international cooperation and regional  integration.  According to Professor Wang Hui, the One Belt One Road Initiative is an example of this. Part of  this new approach is the dual-circulation strategy, which encourages self-reliance domestically,  but also mutually beneficial trade and engagement with other countries. Importantly, new  approaches should not be rigid structures, but flexible enough to adapt in the face of global  shocks caused by threats to stability like climate change and pandemics.

A Better World & Profitability Are Not Mutually Exclusive

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Feike Sijbesma explained why the pursuit of financial success and a commitment to creating a better world are not independent objectives.To address major global challenges, businesses must adopt a long-term time horizon, which demands frequent and transparent communication with stakeholders to build trust.Companies must take risks to integrate societal contributions into their business models, ensuring they are part of a broader solution.Employees and shareholders are increasingly seeking meaningful, transparent, and authentic engagement and investments that address significant global challenges.

  TRANSCRIPT  A Better World & Profitability are not Mutually Exclusive  Elaine Fernandez:  In business, a prevailing misconception is that profitability and societal benefit are diametrically  opposed, which often leads to   inaction when   it comes to social value creation.  However, this notion is disproved by the fact that a growing number of business leaders and  companies that have embraced sustainable practices have not only achieved both ethical and  financial success, many have outperformed their peers over time.  Few are better examples of this than Mr. Feike Sijbesma, Honorary Chairman and former CEO of  DSM   -   a purpose - led science company specialising in solutions for health, nutrition, and  bioscience.  Mr. Sijbesma explains why profitability and societal benefit are in fact not mutually   exclusive and  shares how business leaders can engage stakeholders to co - create solutions for an equitable  society whilst remaining commercially viable.  Feike Sijbesma:  When I started this journey about 15 years ago, I felt a little bit like this is an uphill battle. My  board was not yet fully there, shareholders were not fully there, and the question was to me,  "Okay, Feike, what do you want? You want to create sharehold ers value and doing financially  well, or do you want to create a better world?" And I said both. "No, no, no. Those are mutually  exclusive. So what do you want?" I said both. And let me prove it.  Now, there was a lot of doubt because people felt they were mutually exclusive. Now, 15 years  later, many of the shareholders said and DSM’s share, with all the transformation becoming one  of the most sustainable companies in the world, our share price is   also five times, and the  company's value is five, six times more than it was before, so it worked.  Now shareholders say, "Okay, you are right. Those are not mutually exclusive. They can go hand  in hand together", and I said, thank you very much. My statement is 15 years from now, it's not
  that they can. They have to, they will go, they must go hand in hand together and otherwise you  lose your license to operate.  What I said to our investor relations in the beginning, 15 years ago, we want to go more to the  long - term approach, which we want to have here. And with a long - term approach, maybe we  need to communicate even more than we did before and more frequently. An d my investor  relations said, "Why? Because, if you have less to be taught in the short run, why communicate  more?" I said, "Well, I have to take the whole journey with them.  So, even when I would like to have that more in the longer term, I need to convince them or take  them with me on what I'm going to do during that whole journey". And that's what I did. So, I  said, the more long - term it is, the more complicated it is. Don't   communicate   less but  communicate even more.  But listen, if you really want to contribute to the   society,   you are part of, you need to take those  risks with your company. If you don't do that, you are basically saying we have society on one  end and business on the other hand, and that's not the way it works.  So, I would say to every CEO, think about what kind of environment you operate in. Think how  that environment is changing. Develop insights; insights in yourself, insights in the world you  operate in, insights in the people you collaborate with and see whe re you can be adaptive where  you can adapt your organisation to be more successful in the long run.  And what is success or if you think you are successful, you cannot call yourself successful even  when you are, if you operate in a world that fails. So, look around and you need to take care so  that the world around you does not fail. And that's also to yo ur own success.  And I bet the world is not stupid. The world will spend money on addressing its biggest challenges.  So you can make money if you position yourself well. Your employees want to do something  meaningful with their life, so they will easily join your company.   Your shareholders will see  continuity if you address the biggest challenge of the world and they feel good, uh, by investing  in you and also the people they get the money, the pension people, et cetera, want also that  something good happens with their mone y.
  Elaine Fernandez:  As   Mr.   Sijbesma   has   shared,   market   viability   and   societal   benefit   can   indeed   coexist  harmoniously. Achieving this necessitates proactive stakeholder engagement by people in  business to shift goals toward longer - term, sustainable targets, as opposed to myop ic short - term  gains.  An example of this is how Mr. Sijbesma was personally able to transform the DSM business model  toward having sustainability - driven innovation at its core. During that period, DSM achieved a  450% increase in stock returns with continued success today. This   serves as a real - life testament  to how aligning profit and purpose is not only achievable but indispensable for securing both  financial success and a positive societal impact.

Accelerating Workforce Formalisation: The Business Perspective

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Gayathri Vasudevan shared how civil society organisations (CSO) can engage businesses to drive labour formalisation, emphasising sector-specific and geographic considerations, and initiatives aimed at aligning worker interests with formalisation goals.It is imperative to keep the worker at the centre of formalisation efforts, aligning their interests with a business’s objectives and value chain to drive labour formalisation, as otherwise, business interest in workers is nominal.Rather than attempting to tackle all levers of formalisation independently, businesses should focus on addressing specific levers while collaborating with others who can service other aspects such as housing, finance, or social security.

### transcript
TRANSCRIPT  Accelerating Workforce Formalisation: The Business  Perspective  Host:  Workforce formalisation won't happen without business participation. Because at the end of  the day, it's businesses that will have to implement the regulatory frameworks imposed by  governments to transition informal labour into the formal sector.  This   poses   a couple of challenges. First, businesses may be unaware of how workforce  formalisation ultimately benefits them. Second, even if they're aware, they're often unsure of  how and where to start. Enter civil society, whose role in this instance is not just to highlight the  mutual benefits of formalisation for all stakeholders, but to also illuminate actionable steps that  businesses can take to achieve it.  This is where Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan comes in. As CEO of LabourNet, an India-based social  enterprise which to date has provided skills, training and access to basic needs for over 1 million  people. Dr. Vasudevan will explain how civil society organisations, or CSOs, can counsel and  guide businesses in their formalisation efforts.  Dr. Gayathri Vasudevan:  We've tried to look at it from two perspectives. One is from a sector and trade perspective. For  example, for all beauticians, what is the reality? For all plumbers, what is the reality? And build  around that. That means for that trade and that sector, what are the levers to ensure people are  able to continuously earn and learn and are able to therefore move up the value chain and then  what is required for it?  The second way that we've looked at it is from a geography perspective. That means if I do more  in one geography, in one zip code or so, does it have impact? The more I do there is where I said  the convergence, where the adjacency start kicking in. So how do we really facilitate that in that  geography for that sector and that work?  
So at all points, we've tried to keep the student or the worker at the centrepiece and to see  which business is interested in them, and therefore will the business gain, because they are part  of their larger structure. So they have to be part of the business's value chain or supply chain,  otherwise their interest in them is nominal. Take smaller establishments, establishments having  between 10 to 30 workers and 30 to 200 workers. These typically worked with what they known  as labour contractors.  So they were people who would, quote unquote, bring personnel, you know, male, female, as  per requirement for work, and drop them off. So we are engaging with them to say - Why don't  you start an earn and learn programme, like an apprenticeship programme? So our start point  has been, from there, it will benefit you and it will benefit the worker and you will have a longer  retention of the worker if you do that. And then we start discussing again, you know, is it a  uniform, is it personal protective equipment? It can be a toolkit if it's a beautician.  So we're looking at those conversations which are game changers for them, because the  business also realises that they actually benefit if they formalise. We start the conversation with  the business to say what formalisation will bring to you and then, you know, demonstrate and  then scale it up. But in the last two to three years, we've also been touching on the adjacencies  levers.  For example, does finance, does housing, does healthcare have implications on how a student is  able to partake skill training and therefore be qualified for it, or for a worker to have better  retention rates? That means, does the employer get a better retention rate if we work on  adjacencies? So we've also been looking at those elements and seeing how do we bring it  together under one fold. For businesses, we've tried to simplify it, saying that you take care of  one lever, yours is either a work or an upskilling, or a reskilling or skilling lever. But for the  remaining, there is another corporate who's possibly interested. So somebody could contribute  it from the perspective of housing, because it's business sense for them. They want to sell  better interiors, better exteriors, and therefore does it work for them? Somebody else wants to  focus on the financial inclusion.  You know, in India, it's called the JAM Trinity, which is the opening of the account, the identity,  and looking at it from a social security perspective.  
Host:  The transition from informal to formal labour, with all the levers and adjacencies that need  addressing, can be daunting for businesses. So much so that it often leads to inaction. This is  where LabourNet has helped, by supporting businesses to optimise and humanise their supply  chains for the better.  As Dr. Vasudevan puts it, in the absence of government initiatives, CSOs can interface with  businesses to suggest actionable first steps toward formalisation. In addition, where individual  business entities are unable to fulfil all the necessary levers on their own, CSOs can then push  for collaboration within a network of companies that can each cater for a specific lever or  adjacency.

The Risks of Political Meritocracy

### keyTakeaway
In this chapter, Professor Daniel Bell explored the challenges and intricacies of implementing political meritocracy in China. He discussed the difficulties of ensuring public officials do not abuse their power and maintaining legitimacy in the political system. Tackling corruption is crucial in a political meritocracy to maintain legitimacy. However, a risk exists that political elites become entrenched, especially if there is a significant wealth gap and unequal starting points for individuals. Post-Cultural Revolution, China implemented a collective leadership system to deliberate policies and introduced term and age limits to prevent the excesses of one-man rule. However, recent changes have seen these limits being challenged, raising concerns. A challenge in political meritocracy is legitimising the system to those outside the political elite. This requires implementing democratic mechanisms at lower government levels and ensuring that social mobility is actively supported. 

### transcript
  TRANSCRIPT  The Risks of Political Meritocracy  Elaine Fernandez:  Political meritocracy in China, like all governance systems, carries with it some risks, some of  which can be very significant.  To get a deeper understanding of these challenges, Professor Daniel Bell will discuss how political  meritocracy can suffer from legitimacy issues, especially when it invests too much power in the  political elite, or how it can poorly represent those not in volved in the decision - making process.  Professor Daniel Bell:  The question is how to increase the likelihood that public officials are doing what they're  supposed to do, which is serve the political community with ability and virtue. And so the  advantages of the political system, in theory, are quite clear, right? Th e public officials at the top  would not make beginners mistakes because they have experience. They could plan for the long  term without being worried about thrown out of power.  In the short term, they don't have to waste time giving the same speech over and over again or  raising public funds, and they could spend more time on policymaking. But they're also, like any  other political system, clear disadvantages that must be minimis ed. One, of course, is how to  reduce abuses of power. I mean, the great advantage of electoral democracies is that if you have  bad leaders, at least theoretically, you can vote them out of power.  But what happens in a political meritocracy when the leaders are not doing what they're  supposed to do? So that's one reason why in the period of reform, there were institutions put in  place to minimise the risk of bad leaders or bad policies. One is a col lective leadership system,  which was implemented starting from the late 1970s.  China had a pretty bad experience with the cultural revolution, which was more arbitrary one -  man rule with some policies that were quite bad for the whole country. So there was a system  put in place where the leaders would collectively deliberate about pol icies. Of course, another
  mechanism that was put in place after the cultural revolution to reduce the risk of bad leaders  was term limits and age limits. So public officials would have to retire at a certain point. Now, as  we know, that seems to be a problem at the moment. That is   a risk, frankly, in the political system.  So under President Xi, there's been a much more serious effort to tackle vested interests, to  engage in anti - corruption campaigns, reduce gap between the rich and poor, to promote  environmentally responsible polici es, and that, as mentioned, requires a stronger leader.  There is a risk that at some point, because now we no longer seem to have age or term limits for  leaders at the top, that it could allow for a leader to stay on to a point where they're no longer  as capable, or else they don't respond as well to new situat ions. That is a serious threat the  political system and we'll see. I mean, it's too early to tell if China can overcome that political  system.  Now there are other problems with political meritocracy. One is the risk that the political elites  would become entrenched and there's not enough social mobility. I mean, the ideal of political  meritocracy is that everybody should have the equal opportunit y to be put on the road to political  power. And then there are meritocratic mechanisms, education examinations, performance  evaluations, that would select and promote the minority of those with above average ability and  virtue. But if the starting point is   so unequal, for example, in China there's a huge gap between  rich and poor, and people from rural areas often lack equal opportunities to put them on the  road to political power. For example, they don't have good teachers, so they can't do well on  examina tions that allow them to get into good universities and prepare them for the public  official examinations and so on.  Then there's a risk that the political elites would become entrenched. That's one reason why it's  very important to reduce the gap between rich and poor in China. Not just because it's bad in  and of itself, but it's also bad for a political meritocracy, be cause there has to be a kind of  circulation of elite so that those who do well can rise to the top, even if they're from a relatively  impoverished background, whereas those who are from privileged backgrounds, if they don't do  well on the road to political   power, should be demoted, so to speak. It's very important to  maintain that circulation. And there's a need to constantly reinvent the political mechanisms that  allow for more social mobility. That's a huge issue now.  Another problem with political meritocracy is how to legitimate the system to those who are  outside the political system, right? because by very definition, only a minority of people can rise  to the top. Well, what about those who theoretically are kind of   excluded from the political  system?
  That's why it's very important to have democratic mechanisms at lower levels of government and  to have different kinds of outlets for people to make their views known and to participate in some  form or other in government. There's lots of debates now over   the role of sortition that could  play a role, democratic deliberation, even some modernised mass rule. I mean, all these  mechanisms are important to provide more legitimacy in the post system, especially from the  point of view of those who are formally exc luded from the political system.  Elaine Fernandez:  Despite how well political meritocracy has worked for China, there are inherent risks, like rising  elitism and decreasing social mobility.  Perhaps most significantly, power can become concentrated in the hands of a small number of  leaders, and the misuse of this power can have devastating impacts.
